\chapter*{คำนำ}
\label{sec:orge4d8c6a}
The materials accumulated herein is intended for use as a reading and
teaching references for ME 310: Mechanical Design I. The main objective
of the class is to introduce students to the concepts of mechanical
design by applying knowledge obtained in ME 210: Mechanics of Materials,
coupled with the concept of basic load-bearing component design in this
class.

In this textbook, students will be introduced to engineering design
process and fundamental decisions that are involvd. Basic review of
engineering materials and its application in mechanical design is the
next topic, with additional focus on material selection.

After the previous two chapter to introduce the design process, we brush
up on important materials covered in Mechanics of Materials: axially
loaded members, torsion, bending, and multiaxial stress analysis. This
links to the next chapter, theories of failure, which completes all the
theoretical knowledge required to tackle component design.

Component design is divided into load-bearing components (beams, shafts,
columns, and mechanical springs) and joints (bolted and welded). Finally
we step back and look at a bigger picture of component interaction and
how design of one component can affect the design of another.

Lastly, the text cover a longstanding and ever-growing trend of
computer-aided design by discussing the its basics and employing
Solidworks as a reference software for basic finite element analysis and
design tool.

\chapter{การออกแบบทางวิศวกรรมเบื้องต้น}
\label{introduction-to-engineering-design}
การออกแบบทางวิศวกรรมเป็นการประยุกต์ศาสตร์ทางวิศวกรรมเพื่อกำหนดโครงสร้างหรือระบบหนึ่งๆอย่างละเอียดเพื่อให้สามารถนำไปสร้างได้จริง ในส่วนของของวิศวกรเครื่องกล หน้าที่ของเราในการออกแบบคือกำหนดหาวัสดุ ขนาด และรูปร่างของชิ้นส่วนที่เหมาะสมเพื่อที่ชิ้นส่วนนั้นจะสามารถทำงานและรับภาระได้อย่างที่ต้องการ

การออกแบบที่ดีจะต้องคำนึงคำนึงถึงสมรรถนะ ต้นทุน และความปลอดภัยของชิ้นส่วน การออกแบบที่เหมาะสมที่สุดต้องเป็นทางเลือกที่ดีที่สุดซึ่งยังตอบโจทย์ข้อจำกัดทุกข้อ ซึ่งทางเลือกที่ดีที่สุดอาจจะหมายถึงน้ำหนักน้อยที่สุด ปริมาตรต่ำที่สุด หรือราคาต้นทุทถูกที่สุด เป็นต้น ซึ่งกระบวนการออกแบบโดยทั่วไปมีขั้นตอนหลักๆดังนี้

\begin{enumerate}
\item วิเคราะห์การล้มเหลวแบบต่างๆของชิ้นส่วน

\item หาความสัมพันธ์ระหว่างภาระที่กระทำ ความเค้นลัพธ์ และการเปลี่ยนรูปของวัสดุ

\item Determine the maximum usable value of a significant quantity such as
stress or deformation that may cause failure. Using this value
together with equation(s) obtained from part 2 to determine allowable
loads.

\item Select the safety factor.
\end{enumerate}

The preceding procedure must be adjusted to each individual case, as
certain steps may be unnecessary or obvious. No two design problems are
exactly the same, and no two design solutions should be the same.

\section{Engineering Design Processes}
\label{engineering-design-processes}
Solutions to design problems start at the very first with the
recognition of problems or needs for a part, machine, or system. The
problems or needs are then formulated into sets of requirements and
constraints. In design problems, there are usually more than one right
answer. Design considerations often require a trial-and-error process,
as illustrated by
[[\#fig: engineering design processes]\ref{fig: engineering design processes}].


\url{pictures/intro-eng-design/eng-design-process}

Product realization and production involve multiple, recursive, and
sometimes, concurrent processes. There are also many possible backward
loops where corrections need to be made in earlier stages of design. For
example, during the prototyping period, it is found that two parts that
are intended to mate do not fit together because they shrink during
cooling. It may not be at all possible to change the manufacturing
processes, in which case the components have to be redesigned to factor
in the thermal shrinkage.

In this class, our efforts will be mainly focused on problem
formulation, conceptual, system, and component design. Design
optimization will also be discussed, though only in limited details.

To help facilitate the processes of problem formulation and conceptual
design, a systematic method of determining and addressing requirements
(both functional and mechanical) is needed. Constructing a FRDPARRC
chart is one such method.

FRDPARRC (pronounced FRED-PARK) are initials of columns on a design
chart to help designers tabulate various design considerations. The
initials stand for FR (Functional Requirements), DP (Design Parameters),
A (Analyses), R (References), R (Risks), and C (Countermeasures).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Functional Requirements: a list of independent functions that the
design is to accomplish.

\item Design Parameters: ideally independent means to accomplish each
functional requirement. A functional requirement can have multiple
potential design parameters. The best one must eventually be
selected.

\item Analyses: each potential design parameter's feasibility must be
proven by physical equations, finite element analysis, or
experiments.

\item References: books, contacts, patents, or websites that can be used to
verify and help develop the analyses.

\item Risks: possible complications and issues for each design parameters,
ranked from high to low with explanations.

\item Countermeasures. ideas or plans to mitigate each risk whether
original or off-the-shelf solutions.
\end{enumerate}

To use the chart, create one sheet to each functional requirement/design
parameter pair. Map out all of the required analyses, references, risks,
and countermeasures. Compare all of the potential design parameters and
decide on the optimal one.

FRDPARRC sheet for a coconut meat extraction machine

Design considerations for a coconut meat extraction machine for coconut
milk production.

Given that the final goal is to make coconut milk, which definitely will
involve squeezing ground coconut meat, we will assume that leaving the
meat on the shell does not affect the taste or quantity of coconut milk
obtained. This opens up at least two possibilities to obtain ground
coconut meat. The first is to scrape it off the shell, and the second is
to grind the meat together with the shell. There may be other possible
methods, but in this example we will only consider these two.

Design of a Lawn Mower

Ahh.. Grass lawn maintenance. Very possibly one of the most budget
consuming activities in Thailand household landscaping business
considering how our greenspace tends to be mainly filled by small bushes
and shrubs and square miles upon square miles of grass lawns. Keeping
these laws nice and trimmed will be very time consuming without proper
equipment. In the olden days, we may have two main options: a pair of
grass shears (scissors) or a lawn mower.


\url{pictures/intro-eng-design/grass-shears}
\url{pictures/intro-eng-design/lawn-mower}

Now, each does have its own strength and weaknesses. Shears are very
portable, but very slow. Mower, on the other hand, is very fast, but
also very heavy. By \emph{recognizing} this gap between the two available
solutions, we can start to \emph{formulate} the requirements to fill that
void.


Note that, obviously, there may be other factors that a customer
considers in his grass cutting endeavor. For the purpose of this
example, however, we will only consider speed and portability.

The main component of a grass cutting tool is the cutting component.
Both the shears and the mower use steel blades. The mower blade spins at
high velocity, while grass shears rely on shearing (duh!). To increase
portability, we must reduce the weight and load generated by the
spinning steel blades.

Grass is not terribly hard, we don't need thick steel to generate enough
shear force to cut it. A spinning tough plastic wire will do that for a
much smaller centrifugal load and weight.

The final product is this.


\url{pictures/intro-eng-design/cutter-wire}

There are plenty of additional benefits to switching to wire cutting.
Wires don't send rocks, pebbles, or dirt flying. Lighter cutting
mechanism also means smaller motor and smaller energy source, further
reducing the weight of the system.

\section{Safety Factor}
\label{safety-factor}
Occasionally, it is difficult to determine the numerous factors involved
in various aspects of analysis and design of structures. A significant
area of uncertainty is connected to the assumptions made in stress and
deformation analyses. An equally important item is the nature of
material failure. Added to the uncertainty of any problems are exogenous
factors like types of loads, environmental effects, variations in
material properties, consequences of failure, human safety and
economics, and other considerations.

\subsection{Definition of Safety Factor}
\label{definition-of-safety-factor}
Engineers use a safety factor to ensure against uncertainties involving
strength and loading. This factor is employed to provide guarantee that
the load applied to a component does not exceed the largest load it can
support. The safety factor \(N_s\) is therefore the ratio of the maximum
load that produces failure of the member to the load allowed under
service conditions.

$$N_s = \frac{\text{failure load}}{\text{allowable load}}$$

The allowable load is also called the service load or working load. This
is the basic definition of the safety factor. This ratio must always be
greater than 1 so that a designed component can just sustain the maximum
load at failure. A common approach to design is to use a safety factor
with respect to the strength of the member. In most cases, the applied
load and the stress produced with in the member are linearly related, if
that is the case, the safety factor may also be defined by

$$N_s = \frac{\text{material strength}}{\text{applied stress}}$$

Here, the material strength is either a static or a dynamic property.
When loading is static, the material strength represents either the
yield strength of the ultimate strength, which will be discussed in
Section 4.1. For repeated or dynamic loading, the material strength may
be based on the endurance limit, discussed in Section 4.2. These
definitions of safety factor are applicable for any type of member and
loading condition. In some cases, more than one value of safety factor
can exist because there may be more than one potential mode of failure
for a member---one safety factor for each mode of failure. The smallest
value of safety factor for any component is of the greatest concern
because it is the most likely mode of failure.

\subsection{Selection of Safety Factors}
\label{selection-of-safety-factors}
Choosing an appropriate safety factor to be used for a variety of
applications is one of the most important engineering tasks. The
selection of an appropriate value of safety factor is based primarily on
the following five factors.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Degree of uncertainty about loading. In some situations, load can be
determined with virtual certainty. The loads acting on an engine
valve spring are definitely established by the valve open and valve
close positions. But what loads should be used for the design of
automotive suspension components, whose loads can vary tremendously
depending on the severity of use?

\item Degree of uncertainty about material strength. Ideally, the engineer
would have extensive data pertaining to the strength of the material
as fabricated into the actual parts, and tested at temperatures and
in environments similar to those actually encountered. But this is
hardly ever the case. More often, available material strength data
pertain to samples smaller in size, which has only tested at normal
room temperature and has not been assembled. Even the available data
itself is not a single value but more of a scatter.

\item Uncertainties in relating applied loads to material strength via
stress analysis. Various assumptions involved with stress analysis
from stress concentration to validity of failure theories may give
rise to errors in the calculations.

\item Consequences of failure---human safety and economics. If the
consequences of failure are catastrophic, relatively large safety
factors much be used. Furthermore, if the failure of some relatively
inexpensive part could cause extensive shutdown of a major assembly
line, economics dictates increasing the cost of the part as much as
necessary to virtually eliminate the possibility of failure.

\item Cost of providing a large safety factor. This cost involves a
monetary consideration and may also involve important consumption of
resources. In some cases, a safety factor larger than needed may have
a serious consequences. A dramatic example is an aircraft with
excessive safety factors, making it too heavy to fly. Another example
is that it is possible to design an automobile that is so safe and
strong that even a 'crazy' driver trying to wreck the car would
barely cause a scratch. But in doing so, the designer would penalize
'good' drivers by making them pay for much too strong components than
they need. The prohibitive price certainly would motivate them to buy
competitor's cars.

\item A key point in safety factor selection is balance. All parts of a
machine or system should have consistent safety factors. Components
that might possibly cause human injury or entail major costs should
have the greatest safety factors; components that are comparable in
these respects should generally have about the same safety factor,
and so on.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Recommended Values for Safety Factors}
\label{recommended-values-for-safety-factors}
Keep in mind that this is by no means an absolute rule to follow---more
of a general guideline for safety factor selection. These factors are
based on yield strength.

Safety factor for a training bicycle for toddlers

We want to approximate a proper safety factor for a bicycle for toddlers
(small children). Let us take a balance bike as shown in the figure
below as an example.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/intro-eng-design/balance-bike.jpg}
\end{center}

While individual safety factors may require knowledge of materials and
requirements for each component, we can discuss the safety factor of the
\emph{system}. Referring to table \ref{table: safety factor guideline},
this bicycle probably will be using common materials whose properties
are well known and understood. However, being a children's toy, it can
be subjected to some unexpected 'operating conditions'. (You know, kids
being kids, they will invent some ridiculous ways to play with their
toys.) If we already expect this unexpected operating conditions, we can
simply increase the loading requirement and file this under 'reasonably
constant conditions.' Combining the two, the safety factor should fall
between 1.5 - 2.

\section{Summary}
\label{summary}
Engineering design is a process that combines technical knowledge with
creativity. It is almost in equal parts science and imagination. Unlike
many mathematical equations, design problems usually have multiple
possible answers being equally right.

To design an object, one must first start off by observing and realizing
the need for such objects. Several concepts are then developed and the
best candidate is picked using basic analysis. Once that has been done,
each components should be thoroughly analyzed and optimized for the
design purpose. This part must be done while considering many factors
such as required strength, ergonomics, and material availability. The
designer must all so consider the manufacturing processes and assembly
involved, gauging their feasibility. Prototyping and testing follow,
though there are at times corrections and modifications that must be
addressed.

Designing is multidisciplinary, requiring various branches of
engineering. A good design must properly deal with uncertainty and
variability from the designer, supplier, manufacturer, and end user
sides. To do so, proper calculation techniques and safety factors must
be incorporated. A good design satisfies all required, nonnegotiable
constraints while optimizes negotiable ones.

\section{แบบฝึกหัด}
\label{exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the problem of portable personal transportation (transportation options for one passenger). Determine some of the basic required functions. Draw a FRDPARRC sheet of the problem and fill them out for with at least 2 conceptual designs.
\item What would be proper safety factors of the following components?
\begin{enumerate}
\item An elevator cable
\item Mobile phone case
\item Umbrella shaft
\item Passenger car front bumper
\item Airplane fuselage
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Elaborate on your reasoning. Think about the materials will you choose for the components and their operating conditions. Factor those into your 'proper' safety factor.

\chapter{การเลือกวัสดุ}
\label{material-selection}
The selection of materials and the processes used in manufacturing are
important in the design of any machine component. Strength and stiffness
are typically two key factors considered in the selection of a material.
In recent years, choices of materials have been increasingly influenced
by recyclability, energy requirements, and environmental pollution.
Additionally, cost and availability are also important. When considering
cost, simply considering the material cost is sufficient. Material
choices tend to dictate manufacturing processes involved, which in turn
influence the total cost of a fabricated part. With new materials
emerging constantly, designers are often required to consider the
tradeoffs between overall performance and total cost.

This chapter attempts to summarize some of the basic information and to
emphasize the increasing importance of a rational approach to the use of
empirical material properties data. A material property database is
available at \url{http://www.matweb.com}. The database includes
information on steel, aluminum, titanium, and zinc alloys, superalloys,
ceramics, thermoplastics, and thermoset polymers. Another site
\url{http://www.machinedesign.com} presents general information on
plastics, composites, elastomers, nonferrous metals, ferrous metals, and
ceramics.

\section{Cast Iron}
\label{cast-iron}
Cast iron is a four-element alloy containing iron, carbon, silicon, and
manganese. Additional alloying elements are sometimes added. The
physical properties of a cast iron are strongly influenced by its
cooling rate during solidification. This depends on the size and shape
of the casting and on details of foundry practice. Because of this, cast
iron is usually specified by its mechanical properties rather than by
chemical analysis.

The distinctive properties of cast iron result from its carbon content.
High carbon content makes molten iron very fluid and easy to be poured
into complex shapes. The precipitation of carbon during solidification
reduces shrinkage normally found in other materials. The presence of
graphite in the metal provides excellent machinability even at extreme
hardness level, reduces vibration, and lubricates wearing surfaces. When
the heat is removed rapidly, most of the carbon at the surface remains
combined as iron carbides, which are extremely hard and wear-resistant.

\section{Grey Iron}
\label{grey-iron}
The appearance of gray iron comes from precipitated carbon in the form
of graphite. Gray iron has good wear resistance. Even stronger
resistance can be obtained through various foundry techniques, heat
treatment, or additional alloying elements. While graphite can
significantly weaken cast iron in tension, it can improve the
compressive strength markedly. This advantage is very useful in
construction of members under bending.

Typical applications of gray iron include engine blocks, machine bases
and frames, gears, flywheels, and brake disks and drums.

\subsection{Ductile (Nodular) Iron}
\label{ductile-nodular-iron}
Ductile iron is alloyed with magnesium, which causes excess carbon to
precipitate in the form of small spheres or nodules. These nodules do
not disrupt the structure as much as graphite flakes in gray iron do,
thus giving good ductility along with improved tensile strength,
stiffness, and impact resistance. Ductile iron is specified by three
numbers, as 60 -- 40 -- 18, which denote tensile strength (60 ksi),
yield strength (40 ksi), and elongation (18 percent).

Typical applications include engine crankshafts, heavy-duty gears, and
hardware items such as automobile door hinges.

\subsection{White Iron}
\label{white-iron}
White iron (based on their white appearances of fracture surfaces) is
produced in outer portion of gray and ductile iron castings by chilling
selected surfaces of the mold, thereby denying time for carbon
precipitation. The resulting structure is extremely hard,
wear-resistant, and brittle.

Typical applications are found in ball mills, extrusion dies, cement
mixer liners, railroad brake shoes, rolling mill rolls, crushers, and
pulverizers.

\subsection{Malleable Iron}
\label{malleable-iron}
Typical uses are for heavy-duty parts having bearing surfaces, which are
needed in trucks, railroad equipment, construction machinery, and farm
equipment.

\section{Steel}
\label{steel}
Steel is the most extensively used material for machine components. By
varying the composition, thermal treatment, and mechanical treatment,
manufacturers can obtain a wide range of mechanical properties. Three
basic relationships are fundamental to the appropriate selection of
steel composition.

\begin{enumerate}
\item All steels have essentially the same Young's moduli. Therefore, if
the main concern is the stiffness or rigidity of the component, all
steels should perform equally well and the least costly in terms of
both material and fabrication costs should be selected.

\item Carbon content mainly determines the hardness of steel. Maximum
hardness increases with carbon content up to about 0.7\%, so small and
regularly shaped parts can be heat-treated to give almost identical
hardness and strength with plain carbon steel as with more expensive
alloy steels.

\item Alloying elements (manganese, molybdenum, chromium, nickel, and
others) improve the ease with which steel can be hardened. With these
alloys, the potential hardness and strength can be realized with less
extreme heat treatments. This means that parts with large sections
can achieve higher hardnesses in the core of the section and that
irregularly shaped parts can achieve desired hardness from a more
moderate heat treatment with lower risk from warpage from extreme
temperatures.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Plain Carbon Steels}
\label{plain-carbon-steels}
Plain carbon steels contain only carbon as a significant alloying
element. Low-carbon steels have less than 0.3 percent carbon,
medium-carbon steels have 0.3 -- 0.5 percent, and high-carbon steels
have above 0.5 percent.

\subsection{Alloy Steels}
\label{alloy-steels}
As mentioned previously, the basic purpose of adding alloying elements
to steel is to increase hardenability. represents the results of a study
by Datsko \cite{datsko1977materials} of the relative effectiveness of
various alloying elements in increasing hardenability to steel. The
equations give a relative hardenability factor f as a function of the
concentration of the element used.


 L3cm C3cm C4cm Alloying Element \& Concentration \& Relative
Effectiveness\\
Boron \& \(B < 0.002\) \& \$f\textsubscript{B} = 17.23B\textsuperscript{0.0268}\$\\
Manganese \& \(Mn < 1.2\) \& \$f\textsubscript{Mn} = 3.46Mn + 1\$\\
Manganese \& \(1.2 < Mn < 2.0\) \& \$f\textsubscript{Mn} = 5.125Mn - 1\$\\
Molybdenum \& \(Mo < 1.0\) \& \$f\textsubscript{Mo} = 3.0Mo + 1\$\\
Chromium \& \(Cr < 2.0\) \& \$f\textsubscript{Cr} = 2.18Cr + 1\$\\
Silicon \& \(Si < 2.0\) \& \$f\textsubscript{Si} = 0.7Si + 1\$\\
Nickel \& \(Ni < 2.0\) \& \$f\textsubscript{Ni} = 0.4Ni + 1\$\\

Most alloy steels can be classed as either through-hardening (relatively
penetrative hardening) or carburizing (shallow hardening). The latter is
useful in the case where a hard surface and tough core is desired.

\subsection{HSLA Steels}
\label{hsla-steels}
High-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels were first developed as a class of
relatively low-cost steels providing much of the advantage of more
costly regular alloy steels. In many applications, their greater
strength compared to plain carbon steel allows a considerable weight
reduction with relatively small increase in total cost of the part.
Their main use nowadays still remains in the automotive industry.

\subsection{Case-Hardening Steels}
\label{case-hardening-steels}
Case hardening is a hardening of only the surface material (the case).
It is usually accomplished by carburizing, cyaniding, nitriding,
induction hardening, or flame hardening.

Carburizing is a process that introduces additional carbon into the
surface of a low-carbon steel and then heat-treats it to obtain a high
surface hardness.

Cyaniding is a similar process that adds nitrogen as well as carbon to
the surfaces of low- and medium-carbon steels.

Nitriding adds nitrogen to an already machined and heat-treated part.
The temperature of the process is 1000\$\textsuperscript{\^{}}\(F (538\)\textsuperscript{\^{}}\$C) or
less, and no quenching is involved. This feature eliminates possible
distortion problems. For maximum case hardness, special "nitralloy"
steels (containing aluminum as an alloy) are often used. Medium-carbon
alloy steels (notably 4340) are also nitrided. Induction hardening and
flame hardening heat only the surfaces of parts made of medium-carbon
and alloy steels, then quenching and tempering.

Induction hardening and flame hardening heat only the surfaces of parts
made of medium-carbon and alloy steels, then quenching and tempering.

\subsection{Stainless Steels}
\label{stainless-steels}
Stainless steels contain, by definition, a minimum of 10.5 percent
chromium. Wrought stainless steels are austenitic, ferritic,
martensitic, or precipitation hardening. Cast stainless steels are
usually classed as heat-resistant or corrosion-resistant.

\subsection{Iron-Based Superalloys}
\label{iron-based-superalloys}
Iron-based superalloys are used primarily for elevated temperature
applications, as in turbines. Some authorities consider only the
austenitic materials to be true superalloys. In general, they are used
at temperatures above 1000\$\textsuperscript{\^{}}\(F (538\)\textsuperscript{\^{}}\$C), and the
martensitic materials are used at lower temperatures. Significant
properties of superalloys include at high temperatures strength and
resistance to creep, oxidation, corrosion, and wear. Typical uses are
for parts (including bolts) of gas turbines, jet engines, heat
exchangers, and furnaces.

\section{Nonferrous Alloys}
\label{nonferrous-alloys}
\subsection{Aluminum Alloys}
\label{aluminum-alloys}
Literally hundreds of aluminum alloys are available, in both wrought and
cast forms. The chemical composition of aluminum alloys is designated by
four digits for wrought forms and by three digits for cast alloys.
Thermal treatment, mechanical treatment, or both are indicated by a
temper designation that follows the alloy identification number. The
heat treatment of aluminum alloys to increase hardness and strength is
quite different from the heat treatment of steel. Aluminum alloys are
first held at an elevated temperature long enough to bring the hardening
constituents (as Cu, Mg, Mn, Si, Ni) into solution, then quenched, and
finally age-hardened. The latter causes some of the hardening elements
to precipitate throughout the structure. Some alloys precipitate at room
temperature; others require an elevated temperature (artificial aging).
Although aluminum is a readily castable metal serving a host of useful
applications, casting problems do exist. Shrinkage during casting is
relatively large (3.5 to 8.5 percent by volume), and there is no
mechanism analogous to the beneficial carbon precipitation in cast iron
to counteract shrinkage. Hot shortness and gas absorption can be
problems unless details of appropriate foundry practice are specified
and controlled.

\subsection{Copper Alloys}
\label{copper-alloys}
Copper alloys include a variety of brasses, alloys made principally of
copper and zinc, and bronzes, alloys made principally of copper and tin.
As a class, copper alloys have good electrical conductivity, thermal
conductivity, and resistance to corrosion, but relatively low ratios of
strength to weight. They can be hot- or cold-worked, but they
strain-harden in the process. Ductility can be restored by annealing or
by heat associated with welding or brazing. Specific desired properties,
such as greater strength, resistance to heat softening, and
machinability, can often be markedly improved by adding small amounts of
additional alloying agents.

\subsection{Magnesium Alloys}
\label{magnesium-alloys}
Magnesium alloys are the lightest engineering metals. They are
designated by a system established by the American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM), which covers both chemical composition and
tempers. The designation begins with two letters representing alloying
elements of the greatest and second greatest concentration. The letter
designations are


 C3cm C3cm C3cm A -- Aluminum \& K -- Zirconium \& Q -- Silver\\
E -- Rare earths \& L -- Lithium \& S -- Silicon\\
H -- Thorium \& M -- Manganese \& Z -- Zinc\\

Next are two digits that represent the respective percentages of these
two elements, rounded off to whole numbers. Following these digits is a
serial letter that indicates some variation in composition or minor
alloying constituents or impurities. For example, alloy AZ31B-H24
contains 3 percent aluminum, 1 percent zinc, and is strain-hardened.

\subsection{Nickel Alloys and Nickel-Based Superalloys}
\label{nickel-alloys-and-nickel-based-superalloys}
Nickel alloys are used in a variety of structural applications that
usually require specific corrosion resistance, and strength and
toughness at temperature extremes as great as 2000\$\textsuperscript{\^{}}\(F
(1093\)\textsuperscript{\^{}}\(C) and as low as -400\)\textsuperscript{\^{}}\(F (-240\)\textsuperscript{\^{}}\(C). Typical
physical properties are given in Appendix C-15. The nickel and
Duranickel alloys contain over 94 percent nickel. Monel represents a
series of nickel--copper alloys, based on the mutual solubility of these
two elements in all proportions. They are strong and tough at subzero
temperatures, and especially resistant to stress corrosion cracking.
Hastelloy designates a series of Ni--Mo and Ni--Mo--Cr superalloys.
Several Hastelloys resist oxidation and maintain useful strength and
creep properties in the range of 2000\)\textsuperscript{\^{}}\(F (1093\)\textsuperscript{\^{}}\$C). The
Inconel, Incoloy, Rene, and Udimet alloys are Ni--Cr and Ni--Cr--Fe
alloys.

\subsection{Titanium Alloys}
\label{titanium-alloys}
Titanium alloys are nonmagnetic and extremely corrosion-resistant, have
low thermal conductivity, and have outstanding strength-weight ratios.
On the negative side, they are very expensive and difficult to machine.

\subsection{Zinc Alloys}
\label{zinc-alloys}
Zinc is a relatively inexpensive metal with moderate strength. It has a
low melting temperature and so is readily and economically die-cast.
Typical zinc die castings include automotive parts, building hardware,
office machine components, and toys. Limited use is made of the metal in
other forms.

\section{Plastics and Composites}
\label{plastics-and-composites}
The information contained in this section is a brief overview of an
extensive and complex field. Additional technical information related to
engineering polymers is available at \url{http://plastics.dupont.com/} and
at \url{http://www.sabic-ip.com/}. Volumes of information concerning
composite materials are given in MIL-HDBK 17, Composite Materials
Handbook [15], [16], [17], [18], and [19].

\subsection{Plastics}
\label{plastics}
Plastics constitute a large and varied group of synthetic organic
materials. The basic chemical units of plastic materials are monomers.
Under appropriate conditions, usually involving heat, pressure, or both,
polymerization takes place, combining monomers into polymers. Typical
monomers and their corresponding repeating polymer units are shown in
[[\#fig: polymers and repeating units]\ref{fig: polymers and repeating units}].


\cite{secondaryscience4all}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Material-selection/polymer.png}
\caption{\label{fig: polymers and repeating units}
Monomers and repeating polymer units of common polymers.}
\end{figure}

The addition of more and more monomers to form longer and longer polymer
chains increases molecular weight and vastly alters physical properties.
For example, Figure 3.10 shows \(\text{CH}_4\), which is methane gas.
Adding one \(\text{CH}_2\) unit gives heavier ethane gas (C\$\textsubscript{2}\$H\(_6\)).
Continued addition of \(\text{CH}_2\) units gives pentane, a liquid
(\(\text{C}_5\text{H}_{12}\)), and paraffin wax
(\(\text{C}_{18}\text{H}_{38}\)). At approximately
\(\text{C}_{100}\text{H}_{202}\), the material is tough enough to be a
useful plastic, known as low-molecular-weight polyethylene. The toughest
polyethylene, called high-molecular-weight polyethylene, contains nearly
a half-million \(\text{CH}_2\) units in a single polymer chain.

Polymer chain structures can incorporate side branching, also shown in
Figure 2.2. The degree of branching influences the closeness with which
the chains fit together. This, in turn, influences physical properties.
Minimal branching promotes tight packing of the polymer chains (hence,
strong intermolecular attractive forces), giving relatively high
density, rigid crystalline structures, and also relatively extensive
mold shrinkage. Extensive branching produces a more flexible, amorphous
material with less mold shrinkage and distortion. Physical properties of
the finished plastic can also be altered by copolymerization, the
building of polymer chains with two monomers, and by alloying, a
strictly mechanical mixing or blending of constituents which does not
involve chemical bonds.

Plastics have traditionally been designated as thermoplastic, softening
with heat, and thermosetting, not softening with heat. A preferred
designation is linear and cross-linked. The polymer chains in linear
plastics remain linear and separate after molding. The chains in
cross-linked plastics are initially linear but become joined
irreversibly during molding into an interconnected molecular network.

Cross-linking can be initiated by heat, chemical agents, irradiation, or
a combination of these. Some plastics can be either cross-linked or
linear. The cross-linked form is more resistant to heat, chemical
attack, and creep (better dimensional stability). On the other hand, the
linear form is less brittle (more impact-resistant), more easily
processed, and better adapted to complex shapes.

Glass fiber reinforcement improves the strength of plastics by a factor
of two or more. At substantially increased cost, a further improvement
is obtainable by carbon fiber reinforcement. These relatively new
materials (with 10 to 40 percent carbon) have tensile strengths as high
as 275 MPa. Compared to glass-reinforced resins, they have less mold
shrinkage, lower coefficients of expansion, and improved creep
resistance, wear resistance, and toughness. The new fiber-reinforced
plastics are being increasingly used for machine and structural
components requiring light weight and high strength-to-weight ratios.

Thermosetting plastics benefit similarly from glass reinforcement, the
most commercially important being polyester and epoxy resins. In using
tables giving properties of plastics, it is important as well to recall
pitfalls in the use of such handbook data on the properties of
materials. These pitfalls are particularly true for the data on
plastics. Published values reflect values obtained from standardized
molding conditions that are simple, economical, and readily reproduced.
Strength values corresponding to actual molding conditions may differ
significantly. Furthermore, temperature and rate of loading influence
the strength of plastics to a greater extent than they do the strength
of metals, thus requiring additional effort for the proper selection of
a plastic.

Recall that thermoplastics are generally impact resistant; thermosets
are generally heat resistant.

\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Composites}
\label{composites}
A composite is composed or formed from two or more materials each having
different properties. Within the composite, the materials remain
distinct and separate on a macroscopic level. Composite materials are
not uniform throughout the matrix and are not macroscopically
homogeneous. Composite materials are therefore not isotropic (in other
words, their material properties are not consistent along different
material orientations) nor do they possess uniform directional
properties like metals.

Since a composite is made from combinations of materials they can be
designed to improve thermal and mechanical properties. One major
advantage of some composites is their high strength-to-weight ratio,
which can be four times that of high-strength metals. The
stiffness-to-weight ratios can be seven times that of high-strength
metal.


\url{pictures/Material-selection/composite-types}

As common examples, engineering composites are combinations of strong
fibers such as glass, carbon, and boron bonded together in a material
like nylon, epoxy, or polyester. The constituents of a composite
material are comprised of (1) matrix materials and (2) reinforcement
materials. Various plastic resins and sometimes even metals are used as
matrix materials. Common reinforcement materials are (a) glass, (b)
carbon, (c) SiC, and (d) Kevlar (aramid), which can be in the form of
(i) short fibers, (ii) long fibers, (iii) continuous fibers, (iv)
randomly oriented fibers, (v) woven fibers (cloth), or (vi) particulates
(fillers). Particulates (fillers) can act as reinforcement although they
are usually added to a matrix to reduce costs or achieve specific
material properties. Examples would be glass beads added to a
thermoplastic matrix to reduce cost or mica added to a phenolic matrix
to improve electrical properties and/or material processing. As the
names suggest, reinforcement materials provide improved physical and
mechanical properties---strength and stiffness---and the matrix material
supports, surrounds and maintains the position of and transfers load to
the reinforcement material.

Because reinforcing material is often made from fibers of larger pieces
of the material, the composite benefits from the size effect. The fibers
of smaller diameter have higher tensile strengths than the parent
material. Glass, for example, has a relatively low tensile strength, yet
the glass fiber has a much higher strength than glass in sheet form. The
directionality and orientation of the composite material determines its
properties and behavior. The orientation of reinforcement fibers within
the composite such as (a) parallel, (b) woven, (c) random, (d) wound,
and (e) angled can be used to take best advantage of the directional
properties of the material. Where a ply (single layer) has strong
directionality properties, structures of multiple plies or laminates are
employed where each ply is arranged to provide improved strength and
stiffness.

In general, because of the influence of directionality of the composite
material, a minimum of at least two Young's moduli, a shear modulus, and
a Poisson ratio are needed for the analysis of stiffness. Figure 2.3,
2.4, and 2.5 provide additional information for composite materials with
respect to strength vs. modulus, strength vs. density, and strength vs.
temperature, respectively. Types of composite materials identified
include carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP), glass-fiber-reinforced
polymers (GFRP), SiC-reinforced aluminum (Al-SiC), and
Kevlar-fiber-reinforced polymers (KFRP). Additional technical
information including applications of polymer matrix composites (PMC),
metal matrix composites (MMC) and ceramic matrix composites (CMC) is
provided in references [17], [18], and [19]

\section{Engineering Material Selection Process}
\label{engineering-material-selection-process}
The selection of materials and the processes used in manufacturing a
machine component always influence one another, which in turns
influences the cost of the component. This section introduces the
student to a complex process of materials selection for machine
components. Although actual material selection is based on experience
and specific technical knowledge, this section attempts to provide a
rational basis for the process.

During the design process, overall machine performance is established,
after which components are selected and their specifications are
developed to fit with the previously set machine performance. The
material selection process typically takes place when the detailed
dimensions of the components are determined.

The material selection process usually requires satisfying more than one
constraint, for example, load and thermal or cost and power. This can be
done by mapping the constraints to the material properties that
influence those constraints. The constraints can then be transformed
into the required ranges of material properties, which helps narrowing
down the qualified materials. Cost and availability considerations are
also added to finalize the group of candidate materials.

\subsection{Material Selection Factors}
\label{material-selection-factors}
Important material selection factors to fulfill design requirements are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Availability: The availability of a material refer to the ease and
cost of procuring the amount of material required for the component.
The designer must also assess the risk of the availability and
consider if there are any special treatments needed when obtaining
and processing the material.

\item Cost: Cost should definitely be one of the first factors to be
considered. However, actual material-related costs can vary depending
on the design. These material-related costs are the raw material
cost, cost of processing and manufacturing, cost of installation, and
cost of operation and maintenance. It is also important to consider
other lifecycle costs such as service life, transportation,
recycling, and disposal.

\item Material Properties: The designer must understand the strengths and
weaknesses of materials in consideration.

\item Manufacturing Processes: It is important to understand the links
among chosen materials, the manufacturing process, and the material
properties. Forming, joining, or fastening materials in certain ways
limit the choice of materials; a given material may also limit the
choice of manufacturing processes. And both the choice of materials
and manufacturing processes will limit the range of obtainable
material properties.

\item Formability and Joinability: A chosen material must be able to be
formed into desired shape and/or join with other required components.

\item Finishing and Coatings: The choice of finishing or coating can be an
inexpensive method to enhance material properties without switching
to a stronger, more expensive material.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Materials Selection Charts}
\label{materials-selection-charts}
Browsing through materials whose properties fit within the require
ranges can be a daunting task. As such, Ashby's materials selection
charts, which graphically present material properties in a short and
informative way, can be immensely helpful in facilitating the process of
materials selection. It is important to note that the information
contained in the charts is for rough calculations and not for final
design. After a set of possible candidate materials have been selected,
actual properties of selected materials should be used in the final
design, followed by additional experimental verification and testing.

Some of the most useful charts for mechanical design are illustrated and
discussed here.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Strength-Stiffness Chart
\label{strength-stiffness-chart}
For design requirements that are controlled by elastic design or a ratio
of strength versus Young's modulus, the proper materials can be selected
or compared by (1) energy storage per volume as in springs, \(S^2/E = C\);
(2) radius of bending as in elastic hinges, \(S/E = C\); or (3) deflection
under load as in diaphragm design, \(S^{3/2}/E = C\). For example, if we
want to maximize energy storage per volume before failure, we want to
maximize the value of \(S^2/E = C\). Without other design limitations,
inspection of the chart shows that engineering ceramics have the highest
allowable \(S^2/E\), followed by elastomers, engineering alloys (steels),
engineering composites, engineering polymers, woods, and polymer foams
having decreased values


\cite{ashby2010materials}
\url{pictures/Material-selection/strength-stiffness-diagram}

\item Strength-Density Chart
\label{strength-density-chart}
This chart is used for minimum weight design. By using the guidelines of
constant \(S/\rho = C\), \(S^{2/3}/\rho = C\), and \(S^{1/2}/\rho = C\), a
material that provide minimum weight design for rotating disks, beams,
and plates, respectively can be determined.


\url{pictures/Material-selection/strength-density-diagram}

\item Strength-Temperature Chart
\label{strength-temperature-chart}
Strength-temperature relationship is used to determine suitable
materials for designs that require strength at higher temperature.
Notice that only ceramics have strength beyond 1000\$\textsuperscript{\^{}}\(C, while
alloys and polymers have strength up to only 800\)\textsuperscript{\^{}}\(C and
300\)\textsuperscript{\^{}}\$C, respectively.

Material selection for a gas turbine transmission shaft.

An engineer is aiming to design a new transmission shaft for a luxury
car. He wants the shaft to be as light as possible and to withstand the
temperature of at least 300 C. Cost is not a main concern.

There are obviously two criteria for consideration here. We will first
tackle the temperature limit.

In order for the shaft to still operate above 300 C, the shaft \emph{must}
have strength above that temperature. This is where the
strength-temperature chart is very useful.

According to
[[\#fig: strength temperature diagram]\ref{fig: strength temperature diagram}],
we can draw a vertical line at 300 C. Materials that fall to the left
side do not qualify as they do not possess sufficient strength above 300
C. That means all engineering composites, plastics, foams, along with
aluminum, zinc, and magnesium alloys do not pass this requirement.

For the minimum weight design, we refer to the strength-density chart.
For shaft, the index \(S^{1/2}/\rho\) is used to determine a proper
material. The material (or group of materials) with the highest index
will yield the minimum weight for a given torque requirement. From
[[\#fig: strength density diagram]\ref{fig: strength density diagram}], the
possible candidates are metal alloys. Combining this with the
elimination we have made for the temperature requirement, the qualified
materials are steels, titanium alloys, and Ni alloys.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Material Selection Procedure}
\label{material-selection-procedure}
Just like mechanical design problems, material selection tends to
involve making decisions with neither complete nor accurate information
about the functional requirements of the design. A simple methodology
for materials selection is based on the performance, the importance, and
the availability and final cost of the component.

Though the actual materials selection process can be iterative,
requiring rethinking and decision-changing, when the designer has a
description of the part, the typical selection process typically follows
this path:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Establish required service performances}: Determine the operational
conditions of the component, and translate those conditions into
related material properties. For example, a beam that is to withstand
repeated loadings at high temperature will require a different
material than the one to withstand a static loading at room
temperature.

\item \emph{Select a suitable material}: After the required performances and
corresponding material properties have been identified, the designer
can employ material selection charts to help screen suitable
materials. Once the first round of suitable materials are obtained,
reconsider formability, availability, cost, and other critical
properties to obtain final candidates

\item \emph{Make a final evaluation}: Select the best material for the
application. 'Best' is the material with the best value, defined as
the ratio of overall performance over total cost, or as the material
selection index (SI) where

$$SI = \frac{(\text{availability})(\text{performance})}{\text{total cost}}$$

\item \emph{Test, a lot of tests}: Perform test of the chosen material in
operating conditions. Determine if an extensive testing of the final
product is required. Reevaluate the risk and uncertainty of chosen
material, for example, cost of product failure.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary}
\label{summary-1}
Material selection process is as challenging as other mechanical design
processes. It involves analysis of the requirements, identification of
materials, evaluation of candidate materials, and testing and
verification. The important step is the translation of key functional
requirements to required material properties, but also the inclusion of
risk, economic, and process analysis.

\chapter{การวิเคราะห์ภาระสถิตย์}
\label{static-body-load-analysis}
In this chapter, topics covered in Mechanics of Materials that are
directly related to Mechanical Design are reviewed. Mechanics of
Materials is an important building block on which Mechanical Design is
built upon; an engineer cannot effectively and properly design a
component without understanding the type of loadings, supports, and
stresses applied to the part.

\section{Stress, strain, and stress-strain relationship}
\label{stress-strain-and-stress-strain-relationship}
In engineering, the deformation of a body is specified using the concept
of normal and shear strain. We will look at how stress deforms a body
and how the deformation is quantified.

When a force is applied to a body, it will cause a body to change shape
and size. These changes are called deformation. Note that deformation
may not be uniform throughout the body. For example, one part of the
body may contract while the other may expand.

The main interest in engineering mechanics of solids is to study the
internal resistance of a body under externally applied forces. In
earlier statics or dynamics courses, we study the effect of forces on
rigid bodies. We may study how they move or how the forces distribute
among many members of a structure, but we never study how the force
affects each member. In reality, most bodies are deformable, the degrees
of which depends on their material properties. In this case, we can
still use the equation of equilibrium to determine the internal force
acting inside the body.

$$\sum F = 0$$ $$\sum M = 0$$

\subsection{Concepts of Load}
\label{concepts-of-load}
Considering a surface cutting through the body, there can be 2 types of
forces and 2 types of moments acting on the surface

\begin{itemize}
\item Normal force (\(F\)) acts perpendicular to the surface. This force is
developed when there is an external loads pushing or pulling on the
surface of the body.

\item Shear force (\(V\)) acts in the plane of the surface. It developed when
the external forces tends to cause the surface to slide sideways.

\item Torsional moment or torque (\(T\)) is developed when the loads tend to
twist the segment with respect to another.

\item Bending moment (\(M\)) is developed when the loads tend to bend the body
about an axis lying within the plane of the surface.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definition of Stress}
\label{definition-of-stress}
By definition, stress is the force per unit cross sectional area that it
is acting upon. There are two types of stress, depending on the
direction the force is acting on the surface

\begin{enumerate}
\item Normal stress: force per unit area acting normal to the surface. It
can be expressed mathematically as

$$\sigma  = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{A \to 0} \frac{F}{A}$$

\item Shear stress: force per unit area acting tangent to the surface. This
component can be expressed mathematically as

$$\tau  = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{A \to 0} \frac{V}{A}$$
\end{enumerate}

In the case of shear stress, we can further specify the direction of
stress into rectangular components using \(x\), \(y\), \(z\) coordinate axes,
with \(x\) and \(y\) axes in the direction of the in-plane surface and \(z\)
axis normal to the surface. We can now express the normal stress
components as

$$\sigma _{zz} = \sigma _z = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{A \to 0} \frac{F_z}{A}$$

and the two shear stress components as

$$\arraycolsep=1.4pt\def1.4{2.2}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \tau _{zx} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{A \to 0} \dfrac{F_x}{A} \\
    \tau _{zy} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{A \to 0} \dfrac{F_y}{A}
  \end{array}$$

\subsection{Equilibrium Requirement}
\label{equilibrium-requirement}
Consider an infinitesimal cubic element, illustrated in
[[\#fig: 3d-stress-element]\ref{fig: 3d-stress-element}], with external
forces applied, each of the six faces of the cube will have three
components of stress acting on it. If the stress around the point is
constant, then we can use equilibrium equation to relate some of the
stress components.


\url{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/3d-element-stress}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Normal Stress Components
\label{normal-stress-components}
If we apply the equation of force equilibrium in the \(x\) direction, then

$$\arraycolsep=1.4pt\def1.4{1.5}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \sigma _x(\Delta y\Delta z) + \sigma_x'(\Delta y\Delta z) = 0\\
    \sigma _x =  - \sigma_x'
  \end{array}$$

We can similarly prove that \(\sigma_y = \sigma_{y’}\) and
\(\sigma_z = \sigma_z’\). Therefore, for a constant state of stress, each
of the three normal stress components must be equal in magnitude but
opposite in direction.

\item Shear Stress Components
\label{shear-stress-components}
In similar fashion, the shear stresses on opposite faces are of the same
magnitude but in opposite direction. The force equilibrium in the \(x\)
direction gives

$$\arraycolsep=1.4pt\def1.4{1.5}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \tau _{yx}(\Delta y\Delta z) + \tau_{yx}'(\Delta y\Delta z) = 0\\
    \tau _{yx} =  - \tau_{yx}'
  \end{array}$$

If we consider a pair of shear stresses loading on the element, the
moment equilibrium about the z direction gives

$$\arraycolsep=1.4pt\def1.4{1.5}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \tau _{xy}(\Delta y\Delta z)\Delta x - \tau _{yx}(\Delta x\Delta z)\Delta y = 0\\
    \tau _{xy} = \tau _{yx}
  \end{array}$$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Deformation and Strain}
\label{deformation-and-strain}
In order to describe deformation by changes in the length or by the
changes in angles of the element, we will need to develop the concept of
strain. As in stresses, there are two types of strain.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Normal strain
\label{normal-strain}
The change in the length of a line segment per unit length, whether
elongation or contraction, is called normal strain. For example,
consider the line AB which is contained within an undeformed body with
length \(s\). During its deformation, points A and B move to point A' and
B' and the line becomes a curve having the length \(s’\). The average
normal strain becomes

$$\varepsilon _{avg} = \frac{s' - s}{s}$$

If the normal strain is known, we can use this equation to find the
final length of the line segment after it is deformed. We have

$$s' = (1 + \varepsilon _{avg})s$$

Therefore, strain is positive when the line elongates and is negative
when the line contracts.

\item Shear Strain
\label{shear-strain}
The change in angle that occurs between two line segments that were
originally perpendicular is referred to as shear strain. This angle is
denoted by and is measured in radians. Consider the same cubic element
with shear stress couple applied in the \$xy\$-plane. The angle made by
the original \(x\) and \(y\) axes is \(90^{\circ}\). After the deformation, the
angle is changed by \(\theta\). The shear strain in the plane,
\(\gamma_{xy}\), can be defined as


\url{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/3d-shear-deformation}

$$\gamma _{xy} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{y \to 0} \frac{dx}{y} = \tan \theta  \approx \theta$$

\item Cartesian Strain Components
\label{cartesian-strain-components}
Using the above definition of normal and shear strains, we will now show
how it can be used to describe the deformation in a body. Consider an
infinitesimal element of dimension that is located near a point in the
body. The deformed shape of the element is a parallelepiped, assuming
that very small line segments will remain relatively straight after the
deformation. The approximate lengths of the sides of the parallelepiped
are \((1 + \varepsilon_x)\Delta x\), \((1 + \varepsilon_y)\Delta y\), and
\((1 + \varepsilon_z)\Delta z\) and the approximate angles between the
sides are \((\pi /2) - \gamma_{xy}\), \((\pi /2) - \gamma_{yz}\), and
\((\pi /2) - \gamma _{zx}\). Notice that the normal strains cause a change
in the volume of the element, while the shear strains cause a change in
its shape.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hooke's Law in One Dimension}
\label{hookes-law-in-one-dimension}
Since the stress-strain relationship for most engineering materials
exhibit a linear relationship between stress and strain within the
elastic regime, an increase in stress causes a proportional increase in
strain. This fact was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1676 and is known as
Hooke's law. It can be expressed mathematically as

$$\sigma  = E\varepsilon$$

Here \(E\) represents the constant of proportionality, which is called the
modulus of elasticity or Young's modulus.

\subsection{Poisson's Ratio}
\label{poissons-ratio}
When a deformable body is subjected to an axial tensile force, not only
does it elongate but it also contracts laterally. A French scientist S.
D. Poisson found that the ratio between lateral and the longitudinal
strains are always constant in the elastic regime. This constant is
referred to as Poisson's ratio, \(\nu\), defined as


$$\nu  =  - \frac{\varepsilon _{lat}}{\varepsilon _{long}}$$

Notice the negative sign here since longitudinal elongation causes
lateral contraction, and vice versa. Poisson's ratio has no unit, or
dimensionless, and for most nonporous material it has a value between
0.25 and 0.33.

\subsection{Shear stress-shear strain relationship}
\label{shear-stress-shear-strain-relationship}
Much like the way there is a relationship between normal stress and
normal strain in most engineering materials, shear stress and shear
strain are also related linearly by the equation

$$\tau  = G\gamma$$

\(G\) is called the shear modulus of elasticity and has the same unit as
Young's modulus

\section{Thermal effect}
\label{thermal-effect}
A change in temperature can cause a material to change its dimensions.
If the temperature increases, generally a material expands, whereas if
the temperature decreases, the material will contract. Ordinarily this
expansion or contraction is linearly related to the temperature increase
or decrease that occurs. If the material is homogeneous and isotropic,
it has been found that the deformation of a part having length \(L\) can
be calculated using the formula

$$\delta _T = \alpha \Delta TL$$

where \(\alpha\) is a property of a material, referred to as the linear
coefficient of thermal expansion, measuring strain per degree
temperature, \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature of the part, \(L\) is
the original length of the member, and \(\delta T\) is the change in
length of the part.

However, if the change in temperature varies throughout the length of
the part so that or if varies along the length, then the equation
becomes

$$\delta _T = \int_0^L \alpha \Delta Tdx$$

Without any constraint, the change in length of the part can be computed
using the given equations. However, if the expansion or contraction is
restrained by supports, it will produce thermal stress in the part
because it cannot deform freely.

A rubber bar of original length \(L\) is stretched and glued between two
walls. After that the bar is heated from its initial temperature \(T_0\)
to \(T\) at which point there is no longer any remaining stress inside the
bar. What is the distance between the two walls? Assume the material has
modulus of elasticity \(E\) and coefficient of thermal expansion \(\alpha\).


Assume the distance between the two walls is \(D\). Since there is no
stress in the bar, which means thermal expansion has caused the bar to
expand from original length \(L\) to length \(D\). Therefore,

$$\begin{gathered}
  D - L = \alpha (T - T_0)L \hfill \\
  D = L[1 + \alpha (T - T_0)] \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Heated Steel Bar

A 50-cm long steel cylindrical bar is heated on one end by a bunsen
burner until it reaches a steady state. Initially, the bar has a
constant temperature of 20 \$\textsuperscript{\^{}}\$C. Due to the effects of convection
and conduction, the temperature profile of the steel along its length is
dependent on the distance from the burner \(x\)


Determine the change in length of the beam at steady state, given that
the steel bar has \(\alpha = 13 \times 10^{-6}\) /\$\textsuperscript{\^{}}\$C

Since the temperature is given as a function, we simply need to
integrate the expression to determine the change in length

$$\begin{aligned}
    \delta_T &= \int_0^L \alpha \Delta T dx \\
             &= \int_0^{0.5} 13 \times 10^{-6} (100x^2 - 200x + 400 - 20) dx \\
             &= 13 \times 10^{-6} \left. \left( \frac{100}{3} x^3 - 100 x^2 + 380 x \right) \right|_0^{0.5} \\
             &= 2.2 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}
  \end{aligned}$$

\section{Axially loaded members}
\label{axially-loaded-members}
The main concern here will be the stresses and associated deformations
due to axial loadings. It is often necessary to determine not only the
stresses in an axially loaded member but the deflections as well, The
latter, for example, may have to be kept within limits so that certain
clearances are maintained. This section deals with the elongation or
contraction of slender homogeneous members under axial loading. The
axial stress in these cases is assumed not to exceed the yield strength
of the material. The definition of normal stress, normal strain, and the
relationship between the two given by Hooke's law are employed.

\subsection{Prismatic bars}
\label{prismatic-bars}
When determining the changes in length of axially loaded members, it is
convenient to begin with a coil spring. When a load is applied along the
axis of a spring, the spring gets shorter or longer depending on the
direction of the load.

Similarly, in the case of axially loaded members, they elongate or
shorten depend on the direction of the load. If the load acts toward the
member, it is in compression. If the load acts away from the member, it
is in tension. It is also important to note its natural length L, also
called its free length or relaxed length. Once the member is loaded,
supposedly in tension, it will lengthen by an amount \(\delta\) and its
final length becomes \(L + \delta\). If the material of the spring is
linearly elastic, the load and elongation will be proportional,
following Hooke's law that


$$\arraycolsep=1.4pt\def1.4{2.2}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \sigma  = \dfrac{P}{A}\\
    \varepsilon  = \dfrac{\delta }{L}\\
    \sigma  = E\varepsilon 
  \end{array}$$

And therefore we can derive for these relationships that

$$\delta  = \frac{PL}{AE}$$

This equation shows that the elongation is directly proportional to the
load \(P\) and the member length \(L\), and inversely proportional to the
modulus of elasticity \(E\) and the cross-sectional area \(A\). This
equation works assuming that the bar has a uniform cross section.

\subsection{Nonprismatic bars}
\label{nonprismatic-bars}
However, if the bar is loaded by different axial loads, bar made of
different materials, or its cross sectional area varies throughout its
length, the stress throughout the bar varies. To solve for the total
change in length of this type of problem, we must 1) identify the
segments of the bar, 2) determine the axial forces in the segments from
the free body diagrams, 3) applies the equation to all segments. The
total change in length is the sum of the changes in length in all
segments, or


$$\delta  = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n \frac{P_iL_i}{E_iA_i}$$

In which \(i\) is the index of various segments of the bar and \(n\) is the
total number of segments. Note that the force \(P_i\) is the internal
axial force in the segment \(i\), not the external force.

Some other times, the axial force \(P\) and the cross-sectional area \(A\)
vary continuously along the axis of a bar. In this case, instead of
using an algebraic sum, we must integrate the small changes along the
length of a bar to calculate the total change in length.

Consider a small slither of the bar that has length \(dx\) and
cross-sectional area \(A(x)\) locating at a distance \(x\) from one end of
the bar. Assume the internal force acting on the slither of the bar
follows the function \(P(x)\). The change in length of the slither is
simply


$$d\delta  = \frac{P(x)dx}{EA(x)}$$

And the total elongation of the entire bar is

$$\delta  = \int_0^L {d\delta }  = \int_0^L \frac{P(x)dx}{EA(x)}$$

\section{Torsion}
\label{torsion}
Torsion is a twist of a straight bar when loaded by moments that tend to
produce rotation about the longitudinal axis of the bar.

The convention for the moment, also called twisting moment, follows the
right hand rule. In this chapter, we begin by developing formulas for
the deformations and stresses in circular bars under torsion. We then
analyze the rotating shafts and determine the power they transmit.
Finally, we cover several additional topics related to torsion such as
statically indeterminate members, strain energy, thin-walled tubes, and
nonlinear torsion behavior.

\subsection{Simple torsion}
\label{simple-torsion}
Simple torsion is the case where the cross-sectional area and the torque
throughout the length of the material are constant. The understanding of
simple torsion and its conditions can be applied to other more complex
torsion in upcoming sections.

When a circular bar is twisted by torques \(T\) at the ends, every cross
section of the bar is still identical and is subjected to the same
internal torque \(T\), we say that the bar is in pure torsion. From
consideration of symmetry, it can be proved that cross sections of the
bar do not change in shape as they rotate about the longitudinal axis.
Furthermore, if the angle of rotation between one end of the bar and the
other is small, neither the length of the bar nor its radius will
change.

  \caption{A circular bar under torsion. The figure shows the torque and deformation on the cross section.}
  \label{fig: 3d torsional deformation}
\end{figure}

Consider a circular bar under torsion in
[[\#fig: 3d torsional deformation]\ref{fig: 3d torsional deformation}].
Under the action of torque \(T\), if the left-hand end is fixed, the
right-hand end will rotate through a small angle \(\phi\), known as the
angle of twist. The angle of twist changes along the axis of the bar,
and at intermediate cross sections it will have a value \(\phi(x)\), which
we can prove varies linearly between the ends.

The shear strain in an element of length \(dx\) is simply the change in
the orientation of the originally straight longitudinal line. The change
in the orientation can be defined by the angle of change along the
length, which is

$$\gamma _{\max } = \frac{rd\phi }{dx} = r\theta  = \frac{r\phi }{L}$$

where \(\theta\) is defined as the angle of twist per unit length, or rate
of twist, and \(r\) is the radius of the cross-section. Due to symmetry
and our assumption that the cross section remains unchanged during the
rotation, the radius of the cross section remains undistorted during
this time as well, and therefore the shear strain within the interior of
the bar radius away from the center is

$$ \gamma  = \rho \theta  = \frac{\rho }{r}\gamma _{\max }$$

Since the bar is in pure shear, we can apply Hooke's law in shear to
analyze the state of stress of the bar in torsion. We have

$$\tau  = G\gamma$$

in which \(G\) is the shear modulus of elasticity. We can combine this
equation with
[[\#eqn: strain and angle of twist]\ref{eqn: strain and angle of twist}]
and [[\#eqn: strain and radius]\ref{eqn: strain and radius}] to get

$$\begin{gathered}
    \tau _{\max } = Gr\theta  \hfill \\
    \tau (\rho ) = G\rho \theta  = \dfrac{\rho }{r}\tau _{\max } \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

in which \(\tau_{max}\) is the shear stress at the outer surface of the
bar and \(\tau\) is the shear stress at the interior point of radius
\(\rho\) from the center of the bar.

Now that we have figured out the stress and strain state in a circular
bar under torsion, we will now go on to determine the relationship
between the external load in the case of torsion, the twisting moment or
torque T and the shear stress.

First we consider a small element of area \(dA\) located at a radial
distance \(\rho\) from the center of the bar. The shear force acting on
the surface would be \(\tau dA\) where \(\tau\) is the shear stress at
radius \(\rho\). The moment from the shear force is simply the force times
the distance from the center, \(\tau \rho dA\). We can express this small
moment as

$$dM = \tau \rho dA = \frac{\tau _{\max }}{r}\rho ^2dA$$

The resultant moment is simply the sum of these small moments across the
cross-sectional area


$$T = \int_A {dT}  = \frac{\tau _{\max }}{r}\int_A \rho ^2dA  = \frac{\tau _{\max }}{r}J$$

in which \(J\) is the polar moment of inertia of the circular cross
section. By rearranging this equation, we obtain the maximum shear
stress as a function of applied torque:

$$\tau _{\max } = \frac{Tr}{J}$$

This equation is called the torsion formula. Similar to shear strain,
the shear stress at a distance \(\rho\) from the center of the bar is

$$\tau  = \frac{\rho }{r}\tau _{\max } = \frac{T\rho }{J}$$

Finally, we can also relate the angle of twist of a linearly elastic bar
to the applied torque T by combining Hooke's law in shear and the
torsion formula, for which we get

$$\begin{gathered}
    \tau _{\max } = Gr\theta \\
    \tau _{\max } = \frac{Tr}{J} \hfill \\
    \theta  = \frac{T}{GJ} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

This shows that the rate of twist is directly proportional to the torque
\(T\) and inversely proportional to the product \(GJ\). The total angle of
twist for the bar in pure torsion is

$$\phi  = \theta L = \frac{TL}{GJ} = \frac{T}{k_T}$$

where \(k_T = GJ/L\) is called the torsional stiffness of the bar.

Statically indeterminate torsional analysis in a cylindrical shaft

A circular bar is supported at both ends by ball bearing hubs, allowing
them to rotate freely. Three torques are applied along the length of the
bar, their magnitudes, directions, and locations are shown in the
figure. The bar has diameter of 3 cm, the material it is made of has \(G\)
= 80 GPa. Find the maximum shear stress in each segment and angle of
twist between point B and D.


First, we need to find the torque in each segment. We can use equation
of equilibrium to calculate just that. Using the method of section,
within segment BC,

$$T =  - T_1 =  - 275\text{ Nm}$$

Within segment CD,

$$T =  - T_3 = 175\text{ Nm}$$

The maximum shear stress in each segment is at the outer diameter. We
have

$$\begin{gathered}
  \tau _{\max } = \frac{Tr}{J} = \frac{2T}{\pi r^3} \hfill \\
  (\tau _{\max })_{BC} = \frac{2(275\text{ Nm})}{\pi (1.5 \times 10^{ - 2}\text{ m})^3} = 51.9\text{ MPa} \hfill \\
  (\tau _{\max })_{CD} = \frac{2(175\text{ Nm})}{\pi (1.5 \times 10^{ - 2}\text{ m})^3} = 33\text{ MPa} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Angle of twist between B and D is the sum of the angles of twist in BC
and CD.

$$\begin{gathered}
  \phi_{BD} = \phi _{BC} + \phi _{CD} \hfill \\
  J = \frac{\pi r^4}{2} = \frac{\pi (1.5 \times 10^{ - 2} \text{ m})^4}{2} =
  7.95 \times 10^{ - 8} \text{ m}^4 \hfill \\
  \phi_{BC} = \frac{T_{BC}L_1}{GJ} = \frac{( - 275\text{ Nm})(0.5\text{ m})}{(80\text{ GPa})(7.95 \times 10^{-8}\text{ m}^4)} =  - 0.0216\text{ rad} \hfill \\
  \phi_{CD} = \frac{T_{CD}L_2}{GJ} = \frac{(175\text{ Nm})(0.4\text{ m})}{(80\text{ GPa})(7.95 \times 10^{-8}\text{ m}^4)} = 0.0110\text{ rad} \hfill \\
  \phi_{BD} =  - 0.0216 + 0.0110 =  - 0.0106\text{ rad} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Therefore, the bar twisted in the same direction as \(T_2\) by 0.0106 rad.

\subsection{Nonuniform Torsion}
\label{nonuniform-torsion}
In the case of nonuniform torsion, we have loosened the restrictions
previously and implicitly imposed on the previous section which are that
the bar must be of constant cross section and that the torque throughout
the length of the bar must be constant. In this case, we will use the
method of sections and apply the principles already explained in the
previous section to analyze nonuniform torsion.

To illustrate the procedure, we will divide nonuniform torsion problems
into 3 cases.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Bar consisting of constant cross section segments with constant
torque throughout each segment. For example, as the figure shows, the
bar is made up of three constant cross segments. and throughout each
cross section there is a constant torque.

To analyze this problem, we simply use the method of section to
determine the torque throughout each cross section. Once the internal
torques is determined, we can apply the equations to find the shear
stress or the angle o twist in each segment. The total angle of twist
of the bar is simply the sum of the angles of twist for all segments.
So we have that
\end{enumerate}


$$\begin{gathered}
         \phi  = \phi_1 + \phi_2 + \phi_3 +  \ldots  \hfill \\
         \phi  = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n \phi_i = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n \dfrac{T_iL_i}{G_iJ_i}  \hfill \\ 
       \end{gathered}$$

where \(i\) indicates the numbering index for various segments.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Bar with continuously varying cross sections and constant torque.
When the torque is constant, the maximum shear stress in a solid bar
always occurs at the cross section having the smallest diameter. To
find the angle of twist, we can consider an element of length \(dx\) at
distance \(x\) from one end of the bar. The differential angle of twist
\(\phi\) is
\end{enumerate}


$$d\phi  = \frac{Tdx}{GJ(x)}$$

in which \(J(x)\) is the polar moment of inertia of cross section at
distance x from the end. The angle of twist of the entire bar is the
sum of the differential angles of twist:

$$\phi  = \int_0^L \frac{Tdx}{GJ(x)}$$

If the expression for the polar moment of inertia is not too complex,
the integral can be evaluated analytically; in other cases, however,
it must be evaluated numerically.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Bar with continuously varying cross sections and continuously varying
torque. The bar can be subjected to a distributed torque that varies
along the length of an also varying cross section bar. We can use the
method of sections to find the torque along the length of the bar. We
also need to find the polar moment of inertia along the length of the
bar. Once we know both quantities, we can use the torsion formula to
determine the shear stress. The angle of twist can also be found in
the same manner as case 2 except now the torque is also varying. So
the equation for the total angle of twist becomes
\end{enumerate}


$$\phi  = \int_0^L \frac{T(x)dx}{GJ(x)}$$

This integral usually must be evaluated numerically.

\section{Bending}
\label{section: bending}
When external load is applied perpendicular to the axis of the length of
the beam, it will create a shear force and/or bending moment inside the
beam. The deformation from this type of load is called deflection. In
this chapter, we will analyze the relationship between the external
load, the shear force, the bending moment, and the deflection of the
beam.

\subsection{Pure Bending}
\label{pure-bending}
First we will consider the simplest case of bending where the cross
section of the beam in consideration has at least one axis of symmetry,
and that the applied load is in the same plane as the axis of symmetry.
This will cause bending in the plane of symmetry, resulting in symmetric
beam bending.

\subsection{Longitudinal strains in beams}
\label{longitudinal-strains-in-beams}
The longitudinal strain in a beam can be found by analyzing the
curvature of the beam and the associated deformations. For this purpose,
let us consider a portion of a beam in pure bending subjected to
positive bending moment \(M\). Under the action of the bending moments,
the beam deflects in the \(xy\) plane and its longitudinal axis is bent
into a circular curve. Cross sections of the beam are assumed to remain
plane and normal to the longitudinal axis.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \end{tikzpicture}
 % \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/pure-bending}
  \caption{Deformation in pure beam bending.}
\end{figure}

Because of the bending deformations, cross sections rotate with respect
to each other about axes perpendicular to \(xy\) plane. As shown in
[[\#fig: pure bending]\ref{fig: pure bending}], longitudinal lines of the
convex part of the beam are elongated, while those on the concave side
are shortened. Therefore, the lower part of the beam is in tension while
the upper part is in compression. Somewhere between the top and bottom
surface there is a surface where its longitudinal lines do not change in
length. This surface is called the \emph{neutral surface}. Its intersection
with any cross-sectional plane is called the neutral axis of the cross
section.

The planes containing cross sections intersect in a line through the
center of curvature. The angle between the two planes is denoted
\(d\theta\) and the distance to the neutral surface is the radius of
curvature \(\rho\). The initial distance between the two planes is
unchanged at the neutral surface and thus \(\rho d \theta = dx\). However,
all other lines not on the internal surface either lengthen or shorten,
creating normal strains.

To evaluate the normal strains, consider a longitudinal line located at
a distance y away from the neutral surface in an initially straight
beam. Once the beam deflects, the neutral surface moves with the beam,
but the x axis remains fixed and therefore the longitudinal line is
still located at the same distance \(y\) away. The new length of this
longitudinal line becomes

$$(\rho  - y)d\theta  = dx - \dfrac{y}{\rho }dx$$

Therefore, the corresponding normal strain of this longitudinal line is
simply the change in length divided by the original length, which is

$$\varepsilon _x = \frac{dx - \dfrac{y}{\rho }dx - dx}{dx} =  - \dfrac{y}{\rho } =  - \kappa y$$

where \(\kappa\) is the curvature.

Note the negative sign in the equation; when the point of interest is
above the neutral surface, the part is in compression, and vice versa.

The next step in our analysis is to find the stresses from the strains,
which derive from Hooke's law for linearly elastic materials.

\subsection{Normal stresses in beams}
\label{normal-stresses-in-beams}
Since we have established the relationship between the distance of the
point of interest from the neutral surface and the normal strain in
bending beam, we can now apply Hooke's law for linearly elastic material
to derive the stress in the beam.

$$\sigma_x = E\varepsilon_x =  - E\frac{y}{\rho } =  - E\kappa y$$

This equation shows that the normal stresses, just like normal strains,
vary linearly with the distance \(y\) from the neutral surface. For
example, when the bending moment \(M\) is positive and the beam bends with
positive curvature, the stresses are negative (compression) above the
neutral surface and positive (tension) below it.

However, in order for
[[\#eqn: stress-strain bending]\ref{eqn: stress-strain bending}] to be
useful, we must first determine the location of the neutral axis on the
cross section so that we may find the distance of the point of interest
from it.

The location of the neutral axis can be determined by employing a static
equilibrium equation. We know that the resultant force on any cross
section of the beam is zero. We may then apply
[[\#eqn: stress-strain bending]\ref{eqn: stress-strain bending}] using this
fact, thus we have

$$\int_A\sigma_x dA  =  - \int_A E\kappa ydA  = 0$$

Since the curvature and the modulus of elasticity are constants at any
cross section of the beam, we have

$$\int_A ydA = 0$$

This equation states that the first moment of the area of the cross
section, evaluated with respect to the neutral axis, is zero. In other
words, the neutral axis must pass through the centroid of the cross
section.

\subsection{Moment-curvature formula}
\label{moment-curvature-formula}
We also know that the resultant moment of the normal stresses acting
over the cross section must be equal to the bending moment at that cross
section. Let us first consider the element of force \(\sigma xdA\) acting
on the element of area \(dA\) is in the positive direction when \(\sigma_x\)
is positive. If the element \(dA\) is located above the neutral axis, a
positive stress would produce an element of moment in \(\sigma_xydA\) the
negative direction since it tends to bend the beam downward. Therefore,
we have


$$dM =  - \sigma _xydA$$

The sum of all the elemental moments of the entire cross section is
simply the bending moment:

$$M =  - \int_A \sigma_xydA$$

By substituting \(\sigma_x = -E\kappa y\), we have

$$M =  - \int_A \kappa Ey^2dA  =  - \kappa E\int_A y^2dA$$

which we can define as

$$\begin{gathered}
  M = \kappa EI \hfill \\
  I = \int_A y^2dA  \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

where \(I\) is called the moment of inertia. We can now rearrange equation
3.43 in terms of the bending moment as

$$ \kappa  = \frac{1}{\rho } = \frac{M}{EI}$$

This equation is known as the moment-curvature equation, showing that
the curvature of the bending beam is directly proportional to the
bending moment and inversely proportional to the quantity \(EI\), which is
called the \emph{flexural rigidity} of the beam.

\subsection{Elastic Flexure Formula}
\label{elastic-flexure-formula}
Now that we have located the neutral axis and derived the
moment-curvature relationship, we can determine the stress inside the
beam from the bending moment. Substituting
[[\#eqn: moment-curvature]\ref{eqn: moment-curvature}] into
[[\#eqn: stress-strain bending]\ref{eqn: stress-strain bending}], we have

$$ \sigma_x =  - \frac{My}{I}$$

This equation is called the flexure formula, shows that the stresses are
directly proportional to the bending moment \(M\) and inversely
proportional to the moment of inertial \(I\). The stresses also vary
linearly with the distance \(y\) from the neutral axis.

\subsection{Maximum stress at a cross section}
\label{maximum-stress-at-a-cross-section}
From [[\#eqn: flexure formula]\ref{eqn: flexure formula}], we know that the
maximum tensile stress and compressive stress on a given cross section
occurs at points located the furthest away from the neutral axis. Assume
the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme elements above and
below to be \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) respectively, then the corresponding maximum
normal stresses from the flexure formula are

\begin{gather}
\label{eqn: section modulus}
  \sigma _1 =  - \frac{Mc_1}{I} =  - \frac{M}{S_1} \hfill \\
  \sigma _2 =  - \frac{Mc_2}{I} =  - \frac{M}{S_2} \hfill \\ 
\end{gather}

in which

$$\begin{gathered}
  S_1 = \frac{I}{c_1} \hfill \\
  S_2 = \frac{I}{c_2} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

The quantities \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) are known as the section moduli of the
cross section.

\subsection{Shear stresses in beams}
\label{shear-stresses-in-beams}
When the beam is in pure bending, there are only bending moments and
normal stresses in the cross sections. However, most beams are subjected
to loads that produce both bending moments and shear forces, resulting
in nonuniform bending. In this case, both normal and shear stresses are
developed in the beam.

To derive the formula for the shear stresses in a rectangular beam, we
instead evaluate the vertical horizontal shear stresses acting between
layers of the beam due to convenience, since both have the same
magnitudes.

Let us consider a beam in nonuniform bending. Take an element with two
adjacent cross sections \(mn\) and \(m_1n_1\) with distance \(dx\) apart. On
the left hand face, the bending moment \(M\) and shear force \(V\) is
applied. Since the beam is in nonuniform bending, the bending moment and
shear force may change along the length of the beam, and the
corresponding quantities on the right hand face are \(M + dM\) and
\(V + dV\).


On cross section \(mn\) and \(m_1n_1\), the normal stresses are

$$\begin{gathered}
  \sigma _1 =  - \frac{My}{I} \hfill \\
  \sigma _2 =  - \frac{(M + dM)y}{I} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Next, we separate a small subelement \(mm_1pp_1\) by passing a horizontal
plane through our initial element. Since the bending moments vary along
the axis of the beam, the normal forces acting on the left hand and
right hand sides are no longer of the same magnitude. The forces on the
left \(F_1\) and right side \(F_2\) respectively, are

$$\begin{gathered}
    F_1 = \int \frac{My}{I}dA \hfill \\
    F_2 = \int \frac{(M + dM)y}{I}dA \hfill\end{gathered}$$

The rest of the force must be balanced by the shear force \(F_3\), which
gives us

$$\begin{gathered}
  F_3 = F_2 - F_1 = \int \frac{(M + dM)y}{I}dA  - \int \frac{My}{I}dA  \\ 
   = \int \dfrac{(dM)y}{I}dA \\ 
 \end{gathered}$$

Rearranging this equation, we have

$$ F_3 = F_2 - F_1 = \frac{dM}{I}\int y dA$$

Assuming the shear stress is evenly distributed across the width b of
the beam, making the area the shear force is acting upon is \(bdx\), gives
us

$$F_3 = \tau bdx$$

Substitute this into
[[\#eqn: shear stress eval]\ref{eqn: shear stress eval}] and solve for
shear stress gives

$$\tau  = \frac{dM}{dx}\left( \frac{1}{Ib} \right) \int ydA$$

We know that the quantity \(dM/dx\) is equal to the shear force \(V\). The
integral is evaluated over the part of the cross section that we have
chosen earlier. It represent the first moment of the partial cross
section with respect to the neutral axis. If we denote the first moment
by \(Q\), we have

$$\tau  = \frac{VQ}{Ib}$$

This equation, known as the \emph{shear formula}, can be used to determine
shear stress at any point in the cross section of a rectangular beam.
Note that for a specific cross section, the shear force \(V\), the moment
of inertia \(I\), and the cross-sectional width \(b\) are constant; only the
first moment \(Q\) changes with the distance \(y\) from the neutral axis.

\subsection{Beam deflection}
\label{subsection: beam deflection}
In certain engineering applications, it is more important to understand
the deformation, or deflection, of a beam due to bending moment or shear
force itself than the stresses generated from it. In previous sections
we have developed a method to determine the normal and shear stresses in
bending beams. However, we have not yet developed a method to determine
the deflections themselves. In this section, we will determine the
equation of the deflection curve and also find deflections at specific
points along the axis of the beam.

Deflections are sometimes calculated in order to verify that they are
within tolerable limits. For examples, specifications for the design of
buildings usually place upper limits on the deflections, preventing
cracks in ceilings and walls from large deformation. In the design of
machines and aircraft, specifications may limit deflections in order to
prevent undesirable vibrations.

There are mainly two methods widely used in calculating the deflection
of the beam. The first method is based on using the relationship between
the bending moment and the curvature in the beam. As we have discussed,
the curvature of the beam is simply the second derivative of the
deflection of the beam along its length and, therefore, to obtain the
deflection curve, on must integrate the curvature of the beam. We will
call this the \emph{direct integration approach}. The second method is based
on the relationship between the strain energy in the bending beam and
applied load. Therefore, this method is called the \emph{energy approach}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Direct Integration Approach
\label{direct-integration-approach}
For the purpose of discussion, we will assume that the beam has its
original orientation along the x axis. The deflection, denoted with v,
is the lateral deformation of the beam along the y axis at any position
x along the length of the beam.

When the beam is bent, there is not only a deflection at each point
along the axis but also a rotation. The angle of rotation \(\theta\) of
the axis of the beam is the angle between the x axis and the tangent to
the deflection curve. If \(\rho\) is the radius of curvature and \(s\) is
the length of the curve, we see


$$\rho d\theta  = ds$$

Therefore, the curvature \(\kappa\) is given by the equation

$$ \kappa  = \frac{1}{\rho } = \frac{d\theta }{ds}$$

The slope of the deflection curve is the first derivative \(dv/dx\) of the
deflection curve. Since both \(dv\) and \(dx\) are very small, the slope
\(dv/dx\) is simply the tangent of the angle of rotation. Thus

$$ \frac{dv}{dx} = \tan \theta$$

In similar manner, we also obtain the following relationships:

$$\cos \theta  = \frac{dx}{ds} \text{ and } \sin \theta  = \frac{dv}{ds}$$

Since these derivations are based only upon geometric considerations,
they are valid for beams of any material. Furthermore, there are no
restrictions on the magnitudes of the slopes and deflections.

When we assume that the beam undergo only very small deflections and
angles of rotation, in this case, it is acceptable to assume that the
curvature of the beam is very small. For very small angle,
\(\cos\theta \approx 1\), giving

$$ds \approx dx$$

And so [[\#eqn: deflection curve]\ref{eqn: deflection curve}] becomes

$$ \kappa  = \frac{1}{\rho } = \frac{d\theta }{dx}$$

Also, when the angle is small \(\tan\theta \approx \theta\) so we can
simplify [[\#eqn: tan approx]\ref{eqn: tan approx}] to

$$\theta  = \frac{dv}{dx}$$

Substituting this into
[[\#eqn: deflection curve 2]\ref{eqn: deflection curve 2}] and we have

$$\kappa  = \frac{1}{\rho } = \frac{d^2v}{dx^2}$$

This equation is valid for a beam of any material provided the rotations
are small.

If we assume that the material of a beam is linearly elastic and follows
Hooke's law, and that the curvature of the beam follows
[[\#eqn: moment-curvature]\ref{eqn: moment-curvature}], then we can derive
the \emph{differential equation of the deflection curve} as

$$\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = \frac{M}{EI}$$

This equation can be integrated to find the deflection, provided the
bending moment \(M\) and flexural rigidity \(EI\) are known as a function of
\(x\).

Other equations can be obtained by replacing the bending moment \(M\) with
the shear force \(V\) and the intensity of the distributed load \(q\). We
know that

$$\frac{dM}{dx} = V \hspace{1cm} \frac{dV}{dx} =  - q$$

In the case of a nonprismatic beam, the flexural rigidity \(EI\) is
varying along the length of the beam. We write
[[\#eqn: diff equation of deflection]\ref{eqn: diff equation of deflection}]
in the form

$$EI\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = M$$

Differentiating both sides of this equation and substitute values from
[[\#eqn: shear force and load intensity]\ref{eqn: shear force and load intensity}]
gives

$$\begin{gathered}
    \frac{d}{dx}\left( EI\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} \right) = V \hfill \\
    \frac{d^2}{dx^2}\left( EI\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} \right) = \frac{dV}{dx} =  -q \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

In the case of a prismatic beam, the differential equation reduces to

$$\begin{aligned}
  EI\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} &= M \nonumber \\
  EI\frac{d^3v}{dx^3} &= V \nonumber \\
  EI\frac{d^4v}{dx^4} &=  - q \end{aligned}$$

Each time we integrate produces one constant of integration. These
constants can be solved for by imposing known conditions regarding the
slopes and deflections. The conditions fall into one of these three
categories: 1) boundary conditions, 2) continuity conditions, and 3)
symmetry conditions.

\emph{Boundary conditions} pertain to the deflections and slopes at the
supports of the beam. For example, a simple support keeps the deflection
at zero, and at a fixed support both the deflection and slope are zero.

\emph{Continuity conditions} occur where the regions of integration meet.
Since the beam is not 'broken,' its deflection, slope, and curvature
must be continuous through out its length. We can then impose these
conditions on the points where the bending moment function changes.

\emph{Symmetry conditions} may be available where supports and loading are
symmetric. For example, if a simple beam supports a uniform load
throughout its length, the beam's deflection must be symmetric. It can
then be deduced that the slope of the deflection at the middle must be
zero.

If we have a prismatic beam fixed on one end and a vertical load \(P\)
applied on the other end. What is the deflection curve of the beam and
what is the maximum deflection if the beam has properties \(E\) and \(I\)
throughout its length?


First we must determine the bending moments inside the cross section
along the length. Using the method of sections, we can determine that

$$M(x) =  - P(L - x)$$

We can determine the deflection curve by integrating twice on the
equation and apply boundary conditions on the fixed end

$$\begin{gathered}
  EI\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = M(x) =  - P(L - x) \hfill \\
  EI\frac{dv}{dx} = \frac{P}{2}(L - x)^2 + C_1 \hfill \\
  \frac{dv}{dx} = 0\text{ at }x = 0 \hfill \\
  C_1 =  -\frac{PL^2}{2} \hfill \\
  EI\frac{dv}{dx} = \frac{P}{2}(L - x)^2 - \frac{PL^2}{2} \hfill \\
  EIv =  -\frac{P}{6}(L - x)^3 -\frac{PL^2x}{2} + C_2 \hfill \\
  v = 0\text{ at }x = 0 \hfill \\
  C_2 = \frac{PL^3}{6} \hfill \\
  v =  -\frac{P}{6EI}(L - x)^3 -\frac{PL^2x}{2EI} + \frac{PL^3}{6EI} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

The maximum deflection, naturally, is at the free end. Its value is

$$v(L) =  - \frac{PL^3}{2EI} + \frac{PL^3}{6EI} =  - \frac{PL^3}{3EI}$$

Note that the negative sign means the deflection is downward.

A simply supported beam under a midpoint load.

A prismatic beam with simply supported ends is loaded with a downward
force \(P\) in the middle. Determine the deflection curve of the beam and
its maximum deflection. Assume that the beam has a flexural stiffness of
\(EI\).


We first need to determine the bending moment function of the beam along
its length. Employing the method of section and replacing each end
support by a support force of \(P/2\), we proceed to cut the beam from the
left side, for which we have

$$\begin{aligned}
    M(x) &= P\frac{x}{2}
  \end{aligned}$$

This function, however, true only up to the length \(x = L/2\). Beyond
this point, we will have to take into account the bending moment
generated by the downward for \(P\).

$$\begin{aligned}
    M(x) &= P\frac{x}{2} - P(x-\frac{L}{2}) \\
         &= \frac{P}{2}(L-x)
  \end{aligned}$$

In summary, the bending moment function along the length of the beam is

$$M(x) = \left\{
      \begin{array}{l l l}
        P\dfrac{x}{2} & & x \leqslant \dfrac{L}{2} \\[1em]
        \dfrac{P}{2}(L-x) & & x \geqslant \dfrac{L}{2}
      \end{array} \right.$$

Notice that by substituting \(x = L/2\) in either equation yield the same
bending moment.

Now, using this expression in the direct integration method. For
\(x \leqslant L/2\), we have

$$\begin{aligned}
    EI \frac{d^4v}{dx^4} &= EIv'' = P\frac{x}{2}dx \\
    EIv' &= P (\frac{x^2}{4}) + C_1 \\
  \end{aligned}$$

We can use a continuous boundary condition at \(x = L/2\) to solve for
\(C_1\) once we have obtained the functional form of the deflection curve
for \(x \geqslant L/2\). Preferably, we can also solve for \(C_1\) by
applying symmtetry condition. In other words, we know that the problem
is symmetric about the axis \(x = L/2\), and thus the slope of the beam in
the middle \emph{must} be zero. This way, we do not need to know the
functional form of the right half of the deflection curve.

$$\begin{aligned}
    EIv'(x= \frac{L}{2}) = 0 &= P \left( \frac{L^2}{16} \right) + C_1 \\
    C_1 &= -P \left( \frac{L^2}{16} \right) \\
    EIv' &= P \left( \frac{4x^2 - L^2}{16} \right)
  \end{aligned}$$

Integrating one more time to obtain the left-half curve.

$$\begin{aligned}
    EIv &= \frac{P}{16} \left( \frac{4}{3}x^3 - L^2x \right) + C_2
  \end{aligned}$$

Simple support at \(x = 0\) means there is no vertical deflection at the
point.

$$\begin{aligned}
    EIv(x=0) &= 0 = C_2
  \end{aligned}$$

The left-half deflection curve is

$$v(x) = \frac{P}{16EI} \left( \frac{4}{3}x^3 - L^2x \right)$$

We can proceed with the right-half in similar fashion.

$$\begin{aligned}
    EIv'' &= \frac{P}{2}(L - x) \\
    EIv' &= \frac{P}{2}(Lx - \frac{x^2}{2}) + C_3
  \end{aligned}$$

Solving for zero slope in the middle.

$$\begin{aligned}
    EIv'(x = \frac{L}{2}) &= 0 = \frac{P}{2} \left( \frac{L^2}{2} - \frac{L^2}{8} \right) + C_3 \\
    C_3 &= -\frac{3PL^2}{16} \\
    EIv' &= \frac{P}{2} \left( Lx - \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{3L^2}{8} \right)
  \end{aligned}$$

Integrate one last time to obtain the right-half curve.

$$\begin{aligned}
    EIv &= \frac{P}{2} \left( \frac{Lx^2}{2} - \frac{x^3}{6} - \frac{3L^2x}{8} \right) + C_4 \\
    v(x &= L) = 0 \\
    0 &= \frac{P}{2} \left( \frac{L^3}{2} - \frac{L^3}{6} - \frac{3L^3}{8} \right) + C_4 \\
    C_4 &= P \frac{L^3}{48} \\
  \end{aligned}$$

The right-half deflection curve is

$$v(x) = \frac{P}{4EI} \left( Lx^2 - \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{3L^2x}{4} + \frac{L^3}{12} \right)$$

Due to symmetry in this problem, it is relatively simple to tell that
the maximum deflection occurs at \(x = L/2\). In asymmetric problems, it
may be necessary to rely on calculus to determine the location with the
maximum deflection.

Substitute either the left- or right-half deflection curve with
\(x = L/2\) to obtain the maximum deflection. In this problem, we do the
right-half first.

$$\begin{aligned}
    &v(x = \frac{L}{2}) = \frac{P}{4EI} \left( \frac{L^3}{4} - \frac{L^3}{24} - \frac{3L^3}{8} + \frac{L^3}{12} \right) \\
    &v_{\max} = \frac{-4PL^3}{4(48)EI} = -\frac{PL^3}{48EI}
  \end{aligned}$$

We can also substitute \(x = L/2\) into the left-hand to double-check our
answer.

$$\begin{aligned}
    &v(x = \frac{L}{2}) = \frac{P}{16EI} \left( \frac{4L^3}{24} - \frac{L^3}{2}\right) \\
    &v_{\max} = \frac{P}{16EI} \frac{-L^3}{3} = -\frac{PL^3}{48EI}
  \end{aligned}$$

\item Energy approach (Castigliano's theorem)
\label{subsub: energy method}
This theorem provides a method for finding the deflections of a
structure from its strain energy. The theorem simply states that the
derivative of the strain energy with respect the load is equal to the
deflection corresponding to the load. The derivation of Castigliano's
theorem will show what the theorem physically represents.

Consider a beam subjected to \(n\) number of loads
\(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n\). The deflections of the beam corresponding to
the various loads are denoted \(\delta_1, \delta_2, \ldots, \delta_n\). We
will assume that the principle of superposition is applicable to the
beam and its loads.

Now we will determine the strain energy of this beam. When the loads are
applied to the beam, they gradually increase in magnitude from zero to
their maximum values. Simultaneously, as the load is applied, it moves
through the corresponding displacement and does work. The total work
done by the loads is equal to the strain energy \(U\) stored in the beam,
\(W = U\). Note that \(W\) is a function of the loads acting on the beam.

Next, assume one of the loads, \$i\$th load, is increased slightly by the
amount dPi while the other loads are held constant. This increase in the
load will cause a small increase in strain energy of the beam \(dU\). This
increase may be expressed as the rate of change of \(U\) with respect to
\(P_i\) times the small increase in \(P_i\). Thus, the increase in strain
energy is

$$dU = \frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial {P_i}}}d{P_i}$$

The final strain energy of the beam is

$$U + dU = U + \frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial {P_i}}}d{P_i}$$

Because the principle of superposition holds for this beam, the total
strain energy is independent of the order in which the loads are
applied. Therefore, assume that we first apply the load \(dP_i\), it will
produce the strain energy equal to one-half the product of the load and
its corresponding displacement \(d\delta_i\). Thus, the amount of strain
energy due to the load \(dP_i\) is

$$\frac{dP_id\delta _i}{2}$$

When the rest of the loads are applied, they produce the same
displacement as before and do the same amount of work as before.
However, during the application of these loads, the force dPi
automatically moves through the displacement \(\delta_i\). It therefore
produces additional work equal to the product of the force and the
distance (without the 1/2 factor since the full load acts throughout the
displacement). Thus, the final strain energy for the second loading
sequence is

$$\frac{dP_id\delta _i}{2} + U + dP_i\delta _i$$

But this quantity is the same as the strain energy from the first
loading sequence, namely when the load dPi is applied last, so that

$$\frac{dP_id\delta _i}{2} + U + dP_i\delta_i = U + \frac{\partial U}{\partial P_i}dP_i$$

We discard the first term because it contains the product of two
differentials and are much smaller than other quantities. We then obtain
the following relationship.

$$\delta_i = \frac{\partial U}{\partial P_i}$$

This equation is known as \emph{Castigliano's second theorem}. Castigliano's
first theorem, which states that

$$P_i = \frac{\partial U}{\partial \delta_i}$$

can also be proven using a similar method.

Assume again that we have the prismatic beam with bending modulus \(EI\)
with one end fixed and the other free. Load \(P\) is applied downward at
the free end. Use Castigliano's theorem to determine its maximum
deflection.

The maximum deflection is at the free end. We know that the bending
moment at any length \(x\) is

$$M(x) =  - P(L - x)$$

This allows us to compute the deflection directly by employing
[[\#eqn: energy method]\ref{eqn: energy method}], thus

$$\begin{aligned}
  \delta_i &= \int \left( \frac{M}{EI} \right) \left( \frac{\partial M}{\partial P_i} \right)dx \\ 
              &= \frac{1}{EI}\int_0^L  - P(L - x)[ - (L - x)]dx  \\ 
              &= \frac{P}{EI}\left[ L^2x - x^2L + \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_0^L \\ 
              &= \frac{PL^3}{3EI} \end{aligned}$$

Note that we have the same answer as that of the direct integration
method. The only difference is the sign. Using Castigliano's theorem,
positive deflections indicate that it is in the same direction as the
force, which is downward.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Analysis of Multiaxial Stress}
\label{section: multiaxial stress}
In this section, we will show how to transform the stress components
that are associated with a particular coordinate system into ones
associated with another coordinate system. Once the transformation
equation have been established, we can use them to obtain the maximum
normal and shear stress components at a point and find the orientation
of the element on which they act.

\subsection{2D Stress Transformation}
\label{d-stress-transformation}
Normally, the state of stress at a point in a body is defined by six
independent normal and shear stresses. However, this is rarely
encountered in real life, as we usually approximate and simplify so that
the stress can be analyzed in a single plane. This is called plane
stress. In this case, it is assumed that there is no load on the surface
of a body and the corresponding stress components (both normal and
shear) in the out-of-plane direction are zero. Therefore, the only three
components of stress left are \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\tau_{xy}\)
which act on the sides of the element.

The method of transforming the normal and shear stress components from
the \(x\), \(y\) to \(x’\), \(y’\) coordinate axes will now be developed in a
general manner and expressed as a set of stress transformation
equations.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sign Convention
\label{sign-convention}
Before the transformation equations are derived, we must first establish
a sign convention for the stress components. A normal or shear stress
component is positive when it acts in a positive direction on a positive
face, or it acts in a negative direction on a negative face. The stress
component is negative otherwise.

Given the state of plane stress, the orientation of the inclined plane
on which the normal and shear stress components are to be determined
will be defined using \(\theta\). Note that both coordinate systems
\$x\$-\(y\) and \$x’\$-\(y’\) must form right-handed coordinate systems, meaning
the cross product \(x \times y\) must give the direction of \(z\).


\item Normal and Shear Stress Components
\label{normal-and-shear-stress-components}
The element is sectioned into a right-angle triangle with an angle of
\(\theta\) on the top as in the figure below. The resulting normal and
shear stress on the newly sectioned side can be determined using
equation of force equilibrium as

$$\begin{gathered}
  \sum F_{x'}  = 0; \hfill \\[1em]
  \begin{split}
    \sigma_{x'}\Delta A - (\tau_{xy}\Delta A\sin \theta )\cos \theta  &- (\sigma_y\Delta A\sin \theta )\sin \theta  \\
    &- (\tau_{xy}\Delta A\cos \theta )\sin \theta  - (\sigma_x\Delta A\sin \theta )\cos \theta  = 0
  \end{split} \nonumber \\[0.5em]
  \sigma_{x'} = \sigma_x\cos^2\theta  + \sigma_y\sin^2\theta  + 2\tau_{xy}\sin \theta \cos \theta  \\[1em]
  \sum F_{y'}  = 0; \hfill \\ 
  \tau_{x'y'} = (\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\sin \theta \cos \theta  + \tau_{xy}(\cos^2\theta  - \sin ^2\theta ) \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Once we know \(\sigma_{x’}, \sigma_{y’}\) can be obtained simply by
substituting \(\theta\) with 90 + \(\theta\)

$$\sigma_{y'} = \sigma_x\sin^2\theta  + \sigma_y\cos^2\theta  - 2\tau_{xy}\sin \theta \cos \theta$$

If we know the stress components for all possible orientations of faces
through a point, we say that we know the \emph{state of stress} at a point.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mohr's Circle for Stress Transformation}
\label{mohrs-circle-for-stress-transformation}
The stress transformation can be made easier to understand through the
use of a graphical representation. However, first we have to rewrite
stress transformation using double angle formulas.

$$\begin{gathered}
  \sigma_{x'} = \sigma_x\cos^2\theta  + \sigma_y\sin^2\theta  + 2\tau_{xy}\sin \theta \cos \theta  \hfill \\
  \sigma _{x'} = \frac{\sigma_x}{2}(1 + \cos 2\theta ) + \frac{\sigma_y}{2}(1 - \cos 2\theta ) + {\tau_{xy}}\sin 2\theta  \hfill \\
  \sigma_{x'} - \left( \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2} \right)\cos 2\theta  + {\tau_{xy}}\sin 2\theta  \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

$$\begin{gathered}
  \tau_{x'y'} = (\sigma_y - \sigma_x)\sin \theta \cos \theta  + \tau_{xy}(\cos^2\theta  - \sin^2\theta ) \\
  \tau_{x'y'} = \left( \frac{\sigma_y - \sigma_x}{2} \right)\sin 2\theta  + \tau _{xy}\cos 2\theta \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Square both expressions and add them together, we have

$$\begin{gathered}
    \left[ \sigma_{x'} - \left( \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2} \right) \right]^2 + \tau_{x'y'}^2 = \left( \frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2} \right)^2\cos^2 2\theta  + 2\left( \frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2} \right)\tau_{xy}\cos 2\theta \sin 2\theta  + \tau_{xy}^2\sin^2 2\theta \\
    \hspace{4.7cm} + \left( \frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2} \right)^2 \sin^2 2\theta  + 2\left( \frac{\sigma_y - \sigma_x}{2} \right)\tau_{xy}\cos 2\theta \sin 2\theta  + \tau_{xy}^2\cos^2 2\theta \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Simplifying the expression using trigonometry identities, we have

$$\left[ \sigma_{x'} - \left( \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2} \right) \right]^2 + \tau_{x'y'}^2 = \left( \frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2} \right)^2 + \tau_{xy}^2$$

Since \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\tau_{xy}\) are known quantities for
the problem, we can rewrite the expression as

$$(\sigma_{x'} - \sigma_{avg})^2 + \tau_{x'y'}^2 = R^2$$

Note that this equation represents a circle having radius \(R\) and center
on the \(\sigma\) axis at point (\(\sigma_{avg}\), 0).


This extremely useful graphical representation for stress transformation
was developed by a German engineer Otto Mohr and is therefore called
\emph{Mohr's circle}. The original state of stress can be determined by

$$2\theta_p = \tan ^{-1}\frac{2\tau_{xy}}{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}$$

where \(\theta _p\) is called the \emph{principal direction}. And when
determining the stress components in the material at angle \(\alpha\) from
its original coordinate system, simply draw the line from the center of
the circle at angle \(2\alpha\) from the original state to determine
stress components at this new orientation.

\subsection{Principal stresses in 2D}
\label{principal-stresses-in-2d}
Considering the two points where the circle crosses the \(\sigma\) axis,
these two points are where the two normal stress components are at
maximum and minimum. These two stresses are called the maximum and
minimum principal stresses, respectively. We can represent them in terms
of stresses in plane stress as

$$\sigma_{1,2} = \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2} \pm \sqrt {\frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2}^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}$$

Also note that the shear stress component is zero in this orientation.

\subsection{Maximum Shear Stresses in 2D}
\label{maximum-shear-stresses-in-2d}
At the highest point of the circle represents the maximum shear stress
and its orientation. We can represent the maximum shear stress in terms
of stresses in plane stress as

$$ \tau_{xy} = \sqrt {\left( \frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2} \right)^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}$$

Since the angle between the principal stresses and maximum shear stress
on Mohr's circle is 90 degree, the actual angle between the principal
stress plane and maximum shear stress plan is 45. Also note that the
normal component stresses are equal to \(\sigma_{avg}\).

State of stress of a plane stress element

Determine the principal stresses, maximum shear stress, and the
principal direction in this element


To determine the maximum shear stress, simply substitute the values into
[[\#eqn: max shear stress]\ref{eqn: max shear stress}] and obtain

$$\begin{aligned}
      \tau_{xy} &= \sqrt {\left( \frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2} \right)^2 + \tau _{xy}^2}  \\ 
      &= \sqrt {\left( \frac{20 - ( - 30)}{2} \right)^2 + 25^2}  \\ 
      &= 35.4\text{ MPa}
    \end{aligned}$$

The principal stresses are

$$\begin{aligned}
      \sigma_{1,2} &= \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2} \pm \sqrt {\frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2}^2 + \tau _{xy}^2}  \\ 
      &= \frac{20 - 30}{2} \pm 35.4 \\ 
      &= 30.4\text{ MPa}, \text{ } - 40.4\text{ MPa}
    \end{aligned}$$

The principal direction is

$$\begin{aligned}
      2\theta & = \tan^{-1}\frac{2\tau_{xy}}{\sigma_x - \sigma_y} \\ 
      &= 0.785 \\ 
      \theta  &= 0.393\text{ rad} \\ 
      &= 22.5^{\circ}
    \end{aligned}$$

Analysis of a simply supported shaft under combined loadings.


Determine the critical point location and its state of stress.

It may not be obvious at first glance where the critical point on the
shaft is. In that case, we may want to determine the critical point from
each load and find common locations.

For a midpoint-loaded simply-supported shaft, the critical point is in
the middle (\(x = 0.5\) m) on the top (compressive) and bottom (tensile)
surface. The 10-kN tensile load does not provide any additional critical
point as its resultant stress is uniform throughout the shaft. However,
in this problem, the resultant tensile stress adds up with the tensile
stress at the bottom surface and cancels with the compressive stress at
the top surface. So only the top surface in the middle of the shaft is
the critical point here.



\hspace{2cm}

To determine the state of stress, we must first determine resultant
stresses from axial load and bending. For axial load, we have

$$\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_a &= \frac{F}{A} \\
             &= \frac{10000}{\pi (0.01)^2} \\
             &= 31.8 \text{ MPa}
  \end{aligned}$$

For bending, we have $$\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_b &= \frac{My}{I} \\
             &= \frac{1000(1)(0.01)}{4 \dfrac{\pi}{4}(0.01)^4} \\
             &= 318 \text{ MPa}
  \end{aligned}$$

As mentioned earlier, the directions of both of these stresses are along
the length of the shaft, so we can add them up, giving the final state
of stress as 318 + 31.8 = 349.8 MPa.

\section{Stress Concentration}
\label{stress-concentration}
In cases where the cross section of the component under loading---axial,
torsional, or bending---changes gradually, the formulas derived in
previous sections still yield fairly accurate results. However, if the
cross section changes abruptly, these equations cannot predict the local
stress distribution near the discontinuity. Such local or peak stress is
called stress concentration. This condition occurs around any
discontinuities in a component's cross section such as holes, notches,
fillets, and threads. These features can lead to material failure by
fracture or yield. While the stress and accompanying deformation near a
discontinuity can be analyzed using the theory of elasticity, but
application of either the finite element method or an experimental
technique is more common. It is important to note that stress
concentration is the primary cause of fatigue failures and static
failures in brittle materials.

Experimental results show that the highest stress occurs in the
narrowest part of the cross section close to the discontinuity, and its
magnitude is significantly larger than the nominal, or average, stress.
The ratio of the maximum stress to the nominal stress on the section is
called the stress concentration factor, \(K\), which can be expressed as

$$\sigma _{\max } = K\sigma _{nom}$$

The factor usually depends on the geometry of the discontinuity;
sharper, more sudden ones tend to cause higher stress concentration.
Diagrams of readily available stress concentration factors can be found
for various types of loadings (axial, torsional, and bending) and
discontinuities (holes, fillets, notches, etc.). The diagrams included
herein are by no means exhaustive.

It is important to remember that
[[\#eqn: stress concentration]\ref{eqn: stress concentration}] is valid as
long as the values of \(\sigma_{max}\) do not exceed the yield stress of
the material, since the \$K\$s are based upon a linear stress-strain
relationship. The discussion presented here is also only applicable to
static loads.


\cite{juvinall2006fundamentals}

under axial loading \cite{juvinall2006fundamentals}
\url{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/stress-conc-shaft-shoulder-fillet}

Determine the maximum load this multi-segment cantilever beam can take
given that the beam material has \(\sigma_{allow}\) = 150 MPa.


Use the following diagram for stress concentration factor.


\url{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/stress-conc-shaft-shoulder-fillet-bending}

We must determine the stress at each candidate for critical point,
modified by its corresponding stress concentration factor, leading to
the actual critical point. Obviously, the candidates are at the corners
where the change in cross-sectional area occur.

Let us first consider the stress at point A, which is

$$\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_A &= K(\frac{r}{d}, \frac{D}{d}) \frac{32M}{\pi d^3} \\
             &= K(\frac{3}{30}, \frac{45}{30}) \frac{32[P(0.15 + 0.25)]}{\pi (0.03)^3} \\
             &= 1.68 \times 1.51 \times 10^5 P \\
             &= 2.54 \times 10^5 P
  \end{aligned}$$

A similar analysis can be done at point B.

$$\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_B &= K(\frac{r}{d}, \frac{D}{d}) \frac{32M}{\pi d^3} \\
             &= K(\frac{3}{20}, \frac{30}{20}) \frac{32P(0.25)}{\pi (0.02)^3} \\
             &= 1.5 \times 3.18 \times 10^5 P \\
             &= 4.77 \times 10^5 P
  \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, point B is the critical point of this beam. We can find the
maximum applicable \(P\) by setting the stress equal to the allowable
stress.

$$\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_{allow} &= 150 \times 10^6 = 4.77 \times 10^5 P \\
    P &= 314 \text{ N}
  \end{aligned}$$

Analysis of De Havilland Comet Accident

One of the most dire results of design without proper consideration for
fatigue and stress concentration is the De Havilland Comet aircrafts
which were in operation in 1952. While the aircraft design has many
innovative features, they also influenced subsequent aircraft designers
by two catastrophic failures. With some simplified calculations in this
example, the sources and results of those failures can be illustrated.

Less than two years into service, two of the Comets fell apart during
ascent to cruise altitude. Investigators found that cracks started from
the corner of a forward escape hatch. The figure below illustrated the
location and geometry of the hatch.


\url{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/de-havilland-analysis}

For simplification, assume the following material properties and
geometry for the part.

\begin{itemize}
\item Fuselage: cylindrical pressure vessel thickness = 1 cm, radius = 3 m

\item Cabin pressure: cycling between 0 and 57 kPa

\item Radius of curvature = 5 cm

\item Hole radius = 4 mm

\item Wingspan = 35 m

\item AISI1040: \(S_y =\) 250 MPa, \(S_{ut} =\) 400 MPa

\item Mass at takeoff = 50000 kg
\end{itemize}

Use the following diagram for stress concentration factors.


\url{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/stress-conc-bending-plate}


\url{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/stress-conc-axial-plate}

Determine the safety factor of the safety hatch at the corner.

The stress is the fuselage can be considered as that of the wall of a
cylindrical pressure vessel. The internal pressure during flight is 57
kPa and 0 when landed. The circumferential stress in the wall is

$$\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_c &= \frac{pr}{t} \\
             &= \frac{(57 \times 10^3)(3)}{0.01} \\
             &= 17.1 \text{ MPa}
  \end{aligned}$$

Additionally, there is bending from the inertial load at 1.3g (1.3 times
the weight). Simplify that the inertial load is divided equally between
the two wings and that the divided load acts on the middle of each wing.
We can subsequently calculate the bending moment at the exit hatch.

$$\begin{aligned}
    M &= 1.3(50000)(9.8) \left( \frac{35-3}{2} \right) \\
      &= 1.02 \times 10^7 \text{ N-m}
  \end{aligned}$$

\section{Summary}
\label{summary-2}
In this chapter, fundamentals of mechanics of materials are reviewed. To
be able to analyze and properly design mechanical components, a designer
must understand resultant stresses and deformations from applied loads.
First, stress and deformation analysis for members under single type of
loading---axial load, torsion, or bending---are discussed. Subsequently,
analysis of multiaxial stress and combined loadings are detailed. Since
mechanical components often have to take multiple loads simultaneously,
we must understand the interactions between multiple loads and stresses.

Proficiency in these topics is crucial in the next chapter, which
involves determining material failure under different loading
conditions.

\chapter{ทฤษฎีการล้มเหลวเบื้องต้น}
\label{introduction-to-theories-of-failure}
Material failures occur when solid materials lose their strength due to
external loads. In this section, we will discuss theories that predict
the failure of materials due to multiple types of loadings---multiaxial,
repeated, or compressive. These theories are used to determine the
allowable stresses reported in design codes. Keep in mind that no single
theory can apply to all materials under all situations, and therefore we
must also be able to apply the appropriate theory to the appropriate
situation.

\section{Yield and Fracture}
\label{yield-and-fracture}
In uniaxial state of stress, the material behavior during yield is
relatively simple and can be explained by yield stress criteria.
However, more generally, we must apply failure criteria under a
multiaxial state of stress. The study of the materials that yield is
known as plasticity theory. We only limit ourselves to the first third
of plasticity theory---the prediction of yield initiation.

A yield criterion can be any descriptive statement that defines
conditions under which yielding will occur. It may be expressed in terms
of specific quantities, such as stress state, the strain state, a strain
energy quantity, or others. To develop a yield function, the components
of the multiaxial stress state are combined into a single quantity known
as the effective stress . The effective stress is then compared with the
yield stress , in some appropriate form, to determine if yield has
occurred.

\subsection{Maximum shear stress theory (Tresca criteria)}
\label{maximum-shear-stress-theory-tresca-criteria}
The most common cause of yielding of a ductile material is slipping,
which occurs due to shear stress. If we make a specimen into a highly
polished thin strip and subject it to a simple tension test, we can see
that the slip planes will occur approximately 45 degree with the axis of
the strip. This actually coincides with the direction of maximum shear
stress in a uniaxial stress loading, indicating that ductile materials
yield due to shear stress. The maximum shear stress in a material that
is loaded to its shear stress is \(\tau_{max} = S_y / 2\) where the yield
stress is determined from a simple tension test.

For application we will express the absolute maximum shear stress in
terms of the principal stresses. If the two in-plane principal stresses
have the same sign (both compressive or both tensile), the failure will
occur out of plane and so

$$\tau _{\max } = \frac{\sigma _{\max }}{2}$$

However, if the principal stresses have opposite signs, then failure
occurs in the plane and so

$$\tau _{\max } = \frac{\sigma_{\max } - \sigma _{\min }}{2}$$

Using these equations, we can express the maximum shear stress theory
for plane stress for any two in-plane principal stresses by the
following criteria

$$\begin{array}{l l}
    \begin{gathered}
      \left| \sigma_1 \right| \leqslant S_y \hfill \\
      \left| \sigma_2 \right| \leqslant S_y \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}  &\text{when } \dfrac{\sigma _1}{\sigma _2} > 0  \\[20pt]
    \left| \sigma _1 - \sigma _2 \right| \leqslant S_y &\text{when } \dfrac{\sigma _1}{\sigma _2} < 0 \\ 
  \end{array}$$


illustrates safe combinations of principal stresses under maximum shear
stress criterion. Note the difference in the between the 'safe areas' in
the first and third quadrants, which are squares, and second and fourth
quadrants, which are triangles. In the first and third quadrants, the
principal stresses are both tensile (first) or compressive (third). The
resulting maximum in-plane shear stress is small. Therefore, the
material will fail under normal stress instead of shear stress. In the
second and fourth quadrants, the two principal stress signs are
opposite, resulting in a large in-plane shear stress. In this case, the
material is limited by the shear stress and the safe areas reflect this.

For design equations, the failure condition under MSST with safety
factor Ns can be written as

$$\begin{gathered}
    \begin{gathered}
        \left| \sigma_1 \right| > \frac{S_y}{N_s} \\
        \left| \sigma_2 \right| > \frac{S_y}{N_s}  \\ 
      \end{gathered}  \hspace{1.5cm} \text{when } \dfrac{\sigma _1}{\sigma _2} > 0 \\
      \left| {\sigma _1} - {\sigma _2} \right| > \frac{S_y}{N_s} \hspace{0.6cm} \text{when } \dfrac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} < 0
  \end{gathered}$$

\subsection{Maximum distortion energy theory (Von Mises criteria)}
\label{maximum-distortion-energy-theory-von-mises-criteria}
We know that when a material deforms by an external loading, it stores
energy internally throughout its volume. The energy per unit volume of
material is called the strain-energy density, and if the material is
subjected to a uniaxial stress, the strain energy density can be written
as

$$u = \frac{1}{2}\sigma \varepsilon$$

Similarly, if the material is subjected to three principal stresses then
the total strain energy density becomes

$$u = \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1\varepsilon_1 + \sigma_2\varepsilon_2 + \sigma_3\varepsilon_3)$$

If the material behaves in a linear-elastic manner, we can apply Hooke's
law, which transforms the equation to

$$ u = \frac{1}{2E}\left[\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2 + \sigma_3^2 - 2\nu (\sigma_1\sigma_2 + \sigma_1\sigma_3 + \sigma_2\sigma_3)\right]$$

This strain energy density can be considered as the sum of two parts,
one part representing the energy needed to cause a volume change of the
element with no change in shape, and the other representing the energy
needed to distort the element. The energy stored in the form of volume
change is a result of the average principal stress
\(\sigma_{avg} = \sigma_1 + \sigma_2 + \sigma_3\), since this stress
causes equal principal strains in the material. The remaining portion of
the stress \(\sigma_1 - \sigma_{avg}\), \(\sigma_2 - \sigma_{avg}\),
\(\sigma_3 - \sigma_{avg}\) causes the energy of distortion.

Experimental evidence has shown that materials do not yield when
subjected to a uniform (hydrostatic) stress. M. Huber proposed that
yielding in ductile material occurs when the \emph{distortion energy} per
unit volume of the material equals or exceeds the distortion energy per
unit volume of the same material when it is subjected to yielding in a
simple tension test. This is called the \emph{maximum distortion energy
theory}. To obtain the distortion energy per unit volume, we substitute
the distortion stresses into
[[\#eqn: distortion energy density]\ref{eqn: distortion energy density}].
Expanding and simplifying, we have that

$$u_d = \frac{1 + \nu}{6E}\left[ (\sigma_1 - \sigma_2)^2 + (\sigma _2 - \sigma_3)^2 + (\sigma_3 - \sigma_1)^2 \right]$$

For uniaxial tension test, at yield, we have

$$(u_d)_y = \frac{1 + \nu}{3E}S_y^2$$

Since the theory requires that the distortion energy density be the same
as the distortional energy from multiaxial stress state, we have

$$(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2)^2 + (\sigma_2 - \sigma_3)^2 + (\sigma_3 - \sigma_1)^2 = 2S_y^2$$

Or in the case of plane or biaxial stress, we have

$$\sigma_e^2 = \sigma_1^2 - \sigma_1\sigma_2 + \sigma_2^2 = S_y^2$$

This equation represents an elliptical curve. Once the state of stress
of a material falls outside the ellipse, the material is said to have
failed. In comparison the maximum distortion energy theory is slightly
more aggressive in terms of yield prediction, as shown in
[[\#fig: MDET safe zone]\ref{fig: MDET safe zone}].

The safety factor according to the criterion can be written as

$$N_s(\text{MDET}) = \frac{S_y}{\sigma_e}$$

Failure of a ductile plane-stress element

A plane stress element having \(\sigma_x = 50a\) MPa, \(\sigma_y = 30a\) MPa
and \(\tau_{xy} =  25a\) MPa. If under uniaxial test, the material fails
when the normal stress is 70 MPa, determine the maximum the value a that
will cause the material to fail if it follows



\begin{enumerate}
\item Maximum shear stress criterion

\item Maximum distortion energy criterion
\end{enumerate}

First, the uniaxial test indicates the material's yield stress, which is
70 MPa. In either case, to determine the maximum a, we have to determine
the element's principal stresses

$$\begin{gathered}
      \sigma_{1,2} = \frac{\sigma_x + \sigma_y}{2} \pm \sqrt {\left( \frac{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}{2} \right)^2 - \tau _{xy}^2}  \\ 
      = \frac{50a + 30a}{2} \pm \sqrt {\left( \frac{50a - 30a}{2} \right)^2 + (25a)^2}  \\ 
      = a\left[ 10 \pm \sqrt {10^2 + 25^2} \right] \\ 
      = 37a \text{, } - 17a \\ 
    \end{gathered}$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item For maximum shear stress criterion, since the two principal stresses
are of opposite signs, we know that the maximum stress is in-plane.
We can apply equation so that

$$\begin{gathered}
           \sigma_1 - \sigma_2 = S_y \hfill \\
           (37 - ( - 17))a = 70 \hfill \\
           a = 1.3 \hfill \\ 
         \end{gathered}$$

\item For maximum distortion energy theory, we have that

$$\begin{gathered}
           (\sigma_1 - \sigma_2)^2 + (\sigma_2 - \sigma_3)^2 + (\sigma_3 - \sigma_1)^2 = 2S_y^2 \\ 
           (37a - ( - 17a))^2 + ( - 17a)^2 + ( - 37a)^2 = 2(70)^2 \\ 
           4574a^2 = 9800 \\ 
           a = 1.46 \\ 
         \end{gathered}$$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ductile Coulomb-Mohr theory}
\label{ductile-coulomb-mohr-theory}
Not all materials have the same compressive and tensile strengths. For
example, the yield strengths of magnesium alloys in compression is
approximately 50 percent of their yield strength in tension. The
ultimate strength of grey cast irons in compression, on the other hand,
can be as large as 300-400\% of their tensile strengths.

Mohr's theory uses the results of three tests: tension, compression, and
shear to construct three Mohr's circles describing the state of stress
at yield under the corresponding tests. Tangential lines connect the
circles on the top and bottom of the circles to define a failure
envelope of the theory.

A variation of Mohr's theory, called the \emph{Coulomb-Mohr theory} or the
\emph{internal-friction theory}, assume the tangential lines are straight.
With this assumption, only the tensile and compressive strengths are
necessary. Consider the conventional ordering of the principal stresses
such that \(\sigma_1 > \sigma_2 > \sigma_3\). The theory simply reduces to

$$\frac{\sigma_1}{S_{ut}} - \frac{\sigma_3}{S_{uc}} = 1$$

For plane stress, when the two principal stresses
\(\sigma_1 > \sigma_2 > 0\), the failure condition become

$$\sigma_1 > S_{ut}$$

When \(\sigma_1 > 0 > \sigma_2\), the condition becomes

$$\frac{\sigma_1}{S_{ut}} - \frac{\sigma_2}{S_{uc}} > 1$$

When \(0 > \sigma_1 > \sigma_2\), the condition becomes

$$\sigma_2 <  - S_{uc}$$


For design equations, incorporating the safety factor \(N_s\), simply
divide all strengths by the factor.

$$\begin{array}{l l l}
  \sigma_1 > \dfrac{S_{ut}}{N_s} & & \sigma_1 > \sigma_2 > 0 \\[10pt]
  \dfrac{\sigma_1}{S_{ut}} - \dfrac{\sigma_2}{S_{uc}} > \dfrac{1}{N_s} & & \sigma_1 > 0 > \sigma_2 \\[10pt]
    \sigma_2 <  -\dfrac{S_{uc}}{N_s} & & \sigma_2 < \sigma_1 < 0
  \end{array}$$

\subsection{Maximum principal stress theory}
\label{maximum-principal-stress-theory}
Also called \emph{Rankine's criterion} or \emph{maximum normal stress criterion},
it states that yielding begins at a point in a member where the maximum
principal stress reaches a value equal to the tensile yield stress
\(S_{ut}\). For example, assume that a nonzero principal stress acts at a
point in the member. According to this criterion, yielding will occur
when \(\sigma_1\) or \(\sigma_2\) reaches the value \(S_{ut}\). If the
material is subjected to plane stress, we require that

$$\begin{gathered}
    \left| \sigma _1 \right| \leqslant S_{ut} \hfill \\
    \left| \sigma _2 \right| \leqslant S_{uc} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

These equations are shown graphically in
[[\#fig: MNST safe zone]\ref{fig: MNST safe zone}]. It is seen that if the
stress coordinate at a point in the material falls on the boundary or
outside the shaded area, the material is said to fracture.

  \caption{'Safe-zone' diagram for material under maximum principal stress criterion.}
  \label{fig: MNST safe zone}
\end{figure}

Experimentally, the criterion has been found to be in close agreement
with the behavior of brittle materials that have strain diagrams that
are similar in both tension and compression. The safety factor according
to the criterion can be expressed in design equations as

$$\begin{array}{l l l}
  \sigma_1 > \dfrac{S_{ut}}{N_s} & & \sigma_1 > \sigma_2 > 0 \\[10pt]
  \left. \hspace{-0.23cm}
  \begin{array}{l l l}
    \sigma_1 & > & \dfrac{S_{ut}}{N_s} \\[10pt]
    \sigma_2 & < & -\dfrac{S_{uc}}{N_s}
    \end{array} \right\} & & \sigma_1 > 0 > \sigma_2 \\[10pt]
    \sigma_2 <  - \dfrac{S_{uc}}{N_s} & & \sigma _2 < \sigma _1 < 0
  \end{array}$$

\subsection{Modified Coulomb-Mohr theory}
\label{modified-coulomb-mohr-theory}
Over the years, various empirical theories have been proposed to modify
the basic failure theories. Coulomb-Mohr theory was proposed to predict
fracture in brittle materials for which compressive strength is much
greater than tensile strength. The failure condition is identical to
that of ductile Coulomb-Mohr theory. However, there are still
discrepancies between the condition and experimental results. The
theory, consequently, is slightly modified to better accommodate the
results.

The modified Coulomb-Mohr theory failure condition can be expressed as

$$\begin{array}{c c}
    \sigma_1 < \dfrac{S_{ut}}{N_s} &
      \begin{array}{c}
        \sigma_1 > \sigma_2 > 0 \\ 
        \sigma_1 > 0 > \sigma_2 \text{ and } \left| \dfrac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} \right| > 1 
      \end{array} \\[20pt]
    \dfrac{\sigma_1(S_{uc} - S_{ut})}{S_{uc}S_{ut}} - \dfrac{\sigma_2}{S_{uc}} >
      \dfrac{1}{N_s} & \sigma_1 > 0 > \sigma_2\text{ and }\left| \dfrac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} \right| < 1 \\[15pt]
    \sigma_2 <  -\dfrac{S_{uc}}{N_s} & \sigma_2 < \sigma_1 < 0 
  \end{array}$$

The failure condition diagram for the theory is illustrated in
[[\#fig: MCM safe zone]\ref{fig: MCM safe zone}]

\subsection{Criterion selection}
\label{criterion-selection}
With an exception of a few, most ductile materials have the same tensile
and compressive yield strengths. Therefore, \emph{maximum distortion energy
theory} should be applicable. It is also more convenient than other
maximum shear stress theory in that one mathematical expression applies
to all states of stress regardless of the signs of the principal
stresses. For brittle materials, \emph{modified Coulomb-Mohr theory} shows
the best fit to most experimental results and should be applied.

\section{Fatigue}
\label{fatigue}
Fatigue has been defined as "the progressive localized permanent
structural change that occurs in a material subjected to repeated or
fluctuating strains at stresses having a maximum value less than the
tensile strength of the material" (ASM, 1975). Fracture of a structural
member as a result of repeated cycles of load or fluctuating loads in
commonly referred to as a fatigue fracture or fatigue failure. The
corresponding number of load cycles or the time during which the member
is subjected to these loads before fracture occurs is referred to as the
fatigue life.

The type of fatigue failure can be categorized base on the number of
cycles before failure, \(N\): high cycle fatigue for \(N > 10^7\) cycles and
low cycle fatigue for \(N < 10^7\) cycles. High cycle fatigue is
characterized by small elastic strains and can be captured by
stress-based parameters. Low cycle fatigue, on the other hand, is
characterized by large plastic strains and is captured by strain-based
parameters.

To simplify the problem of fatigue failure, we can assume that the
repeated loading causes the internal stress in the material to take a
sinusoidal form, i.e.


$$\sigma  = \sigma _a\sin 2\pi ft + \sigma _m$$

where \(f\) is the frequency of the load, \(\sigma_a\) is the stress
amplitude, and \(\sigma_m\) is the mean stress. When testing for material
fatigue, it is common to test for the relationship between the exerted
stress and the number of cycles before the specimen fails. This
\emph{endurance} graph or \(S-N\) graph, normally shows that as the alternating
stress amplitude increases, the number of cycle the material can take
before failure decreases. Some materials exhibit endurance limits--lower
limits of stress amplitudes under which the materials no longer exhibit
fatigue fracture. For other materials that do not exhibit endurance
limits, it is customary to define the stresses to cause failure under a
given number of cycle, say \(N = 10^7\), as the \emph{endurance limit} or
\emph{fatigue strength}, \(S_e\).


Typically, steel exhibit this endurance limit. However, many aluminum
alloys do not; there does not exist a minimum stress below which fatigue
does not occur. This is why these aluminum alloys, though lighter,
simply cannot replace steel in many machine design applications.

\subsection{Fatigue under zero mean stress}
\label{fatigue-under-zero-mean-stress}
When the load is completely reversed, resulting in zero mean stress
(\(\sigma_m = 0\)), fatigue failure can mostly be described by stress
amplitude. At the lower end of this spectrum where the number of cycles
to failure \(N = 10^3\), the stress amplitude that leads to failure is
called the \emph{low cycle fatigue limit}, \(S_l\), and can be approximated as

\$\$S\textsubscript{l} = \left$\backslash${
    \renewcommand{1.4}{1.2}
\begin{array}{ll}
  0.9 S_{ut} &\text{ for bending} \\
  0.75 S_{ut} &\text{ for axial} \\
  0.72 S_{ut} &\text{ for torsion}
\end{array}
\right.\$\$

On the far end of the spectrum where \(N = 10^7\), the stress amplitude is
the \emph{endurance limit}, \(S_e\), which can be approximated as

\$\$S\textsubscript{e} = \left$\backslash${
    \renewcommand{1.4}{1.2}
\begin{array}{ll}
  0.5 S_{ut} & \text{ for bending} \\
  0.45 S_{ut} &\text{ for axial} \\
  0.29 S_{ut} &\text{ for torsion}
\end{array}
\right.\$\$

For stress amplitude between the two ends, the expected number of
cycles, \(N\), can be interpolated. The relationship between them can be
written as

$$\sigma_a = 10^cN^b$$

where \(c\) and \(b\) are parameters that can be obtained from

$$\begin{aligned}
  b &= - \frac{1}{3} \log \dfrac{S_l}{S_e} \\
  c &= \log \dfrac{S_l^2}{S_e}\end{aligned}$$

Parameter \(b\) is between \(-0.06\) to \(-0.14\) for most metals.

\subsection{Fatigue under nonzero mean stress}
\label{fatigue-under-nonzero-mean-stress}
Nonzero mean stresses have a significant effect on the fatigue strength
of a material. There have been several relations proposed to describe
the effects of mean stress. Three of such relations are

\begin{enumerate}
\item Soderberg relation
$$\frac{\sigma_a}{S_e} + \frac{\sigma _m}{S_y} = \frac{1}{N_s}$$

\item Gerber relation
$$\frac{\sigma_a}{S_e} + \left( \frac{\sigma_m}{S_{ut}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{N_s}$$

\item Goodman relation
$$\frac{\sigma_a}{S_e} + \frac{\sigma _m}{S_{ut}} = \frac{1}{N_s}$$
\end{enumerate}

where \(\sigma_a\) is the stress amplitude, \(S_e\) is the endurance limit,
\(S_y\) is the yield stress, \(\sigma_m\) is the mean stress, and \(S_{ut}\)
is the ultimate tensile strength. For most metals, the Soderberg
relation yields conservative estimates of critical stress amplitude. The
Goodman relation gives reasonably good results for brittle materials,
whereas it is conservative for ductile materials. The Gerber relation
yields fairly good estimates for stress amplitude for ductile materials.

Fatigue failure of a rod under a periodic tensile load

A cylindrical rod shall operate under a periodic tensile load as shown
in the graph. Material of the rod is AISI1050 which has the following
properties. Yield strength = 427 MPa Ultimate tensile strength = 748 MPa
Modified endurance limit = 300 MPa Determine the suitable diameter of
the rod. Use Soderberg line with \(N_s\) = 3


\url{pictures/Failure-theories/fatigue-example}

The safety factor of a member under alternate loading using the
Soderberg line is as follows

$$\frac{\sigma_a}{S_e} + \frac{\sigma_m}{S_y} = \frac{1}{N_s}$$

The stress amplitude is simply the force amplitude divided by the cross
sectional area of the rod.

$$\sigma_a = \frac{(8000 + 0)/2}{\dfrac{\pi }{4}d^2} = \frac{16000}{\pi d^2}$$

According to the Soderberg relation, we have

$$\begin{gathered}
    \frac{\sigma_m}{S_y} + \frac{\sigma _a}{S_e} = \frac{1}{3} \\ 
    \dfrac{\dfrac{4000}{\dfrac{\pi }{4}d^2}}{427 \times 10^6} + \dfrac{\dfrac{16000}{\pi d^2}}{300 \times 10^6} = \frac{1}{3} \\[1em] 
    d^2 = 6.29 \times 10^{-5} \hfill \\
    d = 7.9 \times 10^{-3} = 7.9 \text{ mm} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$ Therefore, the rod's diameter must be 7.9 mm.

\section{Buckling}
\label{section: buckling}
Whenever a member is designed, it is necessary that it satisfy specific
strength, deflection, and stability requirements. The previous chapters
we have discussed some of the methods used to determine the member's
strength and deflection, while assuming that the member was always in
stable equilibrium. Some members, however, may be subjected to
compressive loads, which, if sufficiently large, can cause the member to
deflect laterally. To be more specific, long slender members subjected
to an axial compressive force are called columns, and the lateral
deflection that occurs is called buckling. Buckling of a column can lead
to a sudden and often disastrous failure of a structure or mechanism,
and therefore special attention must be given to the design of columns
to prevent such problems.

The maximum axial load that a column can support is called the critical
load, \(P_{cr}\). Any additional loading will cause the column to buckle
and therefore deflect laterally. Depending on the supports of a column,
the critical load can vary.

\subsection{Ideal column with pin supports}
\label{ideal-column-with-pin-supports}
In this section we will determine the critical buckling load for a
column that is pin-supported. The column to be considered is an \emph{ideal
column}, meaning one that is perfectly straight before loading, is made
of homogeneous material, and upon which the load is applied through the
centroid of the cross section. When the critical load \(P_{cr}\) is
reached, the column is on the verge of becoming unstable, so that a
small lateral force \(F\) will cause the column to remain in the deflected
position when \(F\) is removed. Any slight reduction in the load \(P\) from
Pcr will allow the column to straighten out, and any slight increase in
\(P\) beyond \(P_{cr}\) will cause further increases in lateral deflection.
Whether or not a column will remain stable or become unstable when
subjected to an axial load will depend on its ability to restore itself,
which is based on its resistance to bending. Therefore, to determine the
critical load and the buckled shape of the column, we will apply the
equation for beam bending,

$$EI\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = M$$

Recall that this equation assumes that the slope of the curve is small
and that deflections occur only by bending. When the column is in its
deflected position, the internal bending moment can be determined by
using the method of sections. The bending moment in the beam is simply
the product of the compressive load \(P\) and the maximum deflection in
the middle \(v\). Note that the bending moment is negative, according to
the sign convention used to establish equation so that \(M = –Pv\). Thus
equation becomes


$$\begin{gathered}
    EI\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} =  - Pv \\
    \frac{d^2v}{dx^2} + \left( \frac{P}{EI} \right)v = 0 
  \end{gathered}$$

This is a homogeneous second order linear differential equation with
constant coefficients. The solution is of the form

$$ v = C_1\sin \left( \sqrt {\frac{P}{EI} x} \right) + C_2\cos \left( \sqrt {\frac{P}{EI}} x \right)$$

Using the two boundary conditions that \(v(x = 0) = 0\) and
\(v(x = L) = 0\), it can be determined that \(C_2 = 0\) and

$$C_1\sin \left( \sqrt {\frac{P}{EI}} L \right) = 0$$

One way for this solution to be valid is for \(C_1 = 0\), but this means
that the column will remain straight since it leads to \(v = 0\). This is
a trivial solution and is not particularly interesting. The other, more
interesting possibility is for

$$\sin \left( \sqrt {\frac{P}{EI}} L \right) = 0$$

which is satisfied if

$$ \sqrt {\frac{P}{EI}} L = n\pi$$

or

$$P = \frac{n^2\pi^2EI}{L^2} \hspace{1cm}n = 1,2,3,...$$

The smallest value of \(P_{cr}\) is obtained when \(n = 1\), so the
\emph{critical load} for the column is therefore

$$P_{cr} = \frac{\pi ^2EI}{L^2}$$

This load is sometimes referred to as the \emph{Euler load}.

For the corresponding buckling mode shapes, substitute the expression in
equation [[\#eqn: mode shape sub]\ref{eqn: mode shape sub}] into
[[\#eqn: gen solution]\ref{eqn: gen solution}] along with other solved
parameters, we have

$$v = C_2\sin \frac{n\pi x}{L}$$

Let us explore other buckling loads and their corresponding mode shapes.
For \(n = 2\), we have

$$P = \frac{4 \pi^2 E I}{L^2}$$

and the mode shape is described by

$$v = C_2 \sin \frac{2 \pi x}{L}$$


And for \(n=3\), the buckling load and corresponding mode shape are

$$P = \frac{4 \pi^2 E I}{L^2}$$

$$v = C_2 \sin \frac{2 \pi x}{L}$$


For purposes of design, the critical load equation can also be written
in a more useful form by expressing \(I = Ar_g^2\), where \(A\) is the
cross-sectional area and \(r_g\) is the \emph{radius of gyration} of the
cross-sectional area. Thus,

$$\begin{gathered}
  P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2EAr_g^2)}{L^2} \\ 
  \left( \frac{P}{A} \right)_{cr} = \frac{\pi ^2E}{(L/r_g)^2}\end{gathered}$$

or

$$\sigma_{cr} = \frac{\pi ^2E}{(L/r_g)^2}$$

The geometric ratio \(L/r_g\) is known as the \emph{slenderness ratio}. It is a
measure of the column's flexibility.

\subsection{Columns having various types of supports}
\label{columns-having-various-types-of-supports}
In some other cases where the columns are supported in some other way,
so that the column's ends may be restricted against rotations or
deflection in different ways, determination of the buckling load on the
column follows the same procedure. Take, for example, a column whose one
end is fixed while the other is free. Assume that the compressive load
is exerted onto the free end. The internal bending moment at an
arbitrary section, whose lateral deflection is \(v\), is
\(M = P(\delta – v)\). The differential equation for the deflection curve
is


$$\begin{gathered}
  EI\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = P(\delta  - v) \\ 
  \frac{d^2v}{dx^2} + \frac{P}{EI}v = \frac{P}{EI}\delta  \\ \end{gathered}$$

Since this equation is nonhomogeneous, the solution consists of both a
complementary and particular solutions.

$$v = C_1\sin \left( \sqrt {\frac{P}{EI}} x \right) + C_2\cos \left( \sqrt {\frac{P}{EI}} x \right) + \delta$$

Solving for constants of integration using \(v(x = 0) = 0\) and
\(v(x = L) = \delta\), we have that

$$\delta \cos \left( \sqrt {\frac{P}{EI}} L \right) = 0$$

The nontrivial solution indicates that

$$\begin{gathered}
  \cos \left( \sqrt {\frac{P}{EI}} L \right) = 0 \\
  \sqrt {\frac{P}{EI}} L = \frac{n\pi }{2}\end{gathered}$$

The smallest critical load (\(n = 1\)) is

$$P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2EI}{4L^2}$$

By comparison, this critical load is a quarter of the critical load of a
pin-supported column. Similar derivations can be used to determine the
critical loads of those columns whose supports are different from the
ones already given. For the case of a column having ends that are pinned
or free to rotate, \(L\) represents the unsupported distance between the
points of zero moment. For other types of supports, the column's
\emph{effective length}, \(L_e\), can be used to represent that length and
substituted into the critical load equation so that

\begin{gather}
\label{eqn: Euler's formula}
  P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2EI}{L_e^2} = \frac{\pi ^2EI}{(KL)^2} \hfill \\
  \sigma_{cr} = \frac{\pi ^2E}{\lambda^2} \hfill \\ 
\end{gather}

where \(L_e = KL\) in which \(K\) is the \emph{effective-length factor} and
\(KL/r_g\) is the \emph{effective-slenderness ratio}. The table of \(K\) values
for various end supports is given below.


 L4.5cm C3cm End Support \& \(K\) value\\

Fixed and free ends \& 2\\
Fixed ends \& 0.5\\
Pinned and fixed ends \& 0.7\\

Before the development of proper installation technique, train track
buckling problems due to thermal loads plague continuous welded rails
(CWR). Let us assume that a section of a welded rail is 10 m long and
its cross-sectional moment of inertia and area are 400 cm\(^4\) and 73
cm\(^2\). The rail is made of steel with \(\alpha = 12 \times 10^-6\)
C\(^{-1}\) and \(E = 210\) GPa. Determine the change in temperature that
will lead to buckling.


\url{pictures/Failure-theories/Rail\_buckle}

Buckling due to thermal load is a combination between two problems:
buckling and thermal load. Assuming that rail buckling happens on a
first mode (\(n = 1\)), we have that

\begin{equation}
  P_{cr} = \frac{ \pi^2 EI }{ L^2 } 
\end{equation}

Now we need to determine the change in temperature that will lead to
that critical load. Let points A and B be the two ends of the rail.
Following steps to solve a statically indeterminate problem (equilibrium
equation, compabitility equation, and Hooke's law), we can write that:

\begin{equation*}
  F_A = F_B = F
\end{equation*}

Since the two ends of the rail are supported, its length cannot change,
i.e. the changes in length due to support force and thermal change must
cancel out.

\begin{gather*}
  &\delta_{AB} = 0 \\
  &\delta_T + \delta_F = 0
\end{gather*}

Applying Hooke's law and thermal elongation to the equation, we can
solve for the support force \(F\)

\begin{align*}
  &\alpha \Delta T L + \frac {FL}{AE} = 0 \\
  &F = -\alpha \Delta T A E
\end{align*}

Finally, we know that the support force \(F\) must be equal to the
critical load \(P_{cr}\) to cause buckling. We must, however, flip the
sign of \(F\) because \(F > 0\) is tensile load while \(P_{cr}\) is always
compressive.

\begin{gather*}
  -F = P_{cr} \hfill \\
  \alpha \Delta T A E = \frac{ \pi^2 EI }{ L^2 } \hfill \\
  \begin{aligned}
    \Delta T &= \frac{ \pi^2 I }{ \alpha A L^2} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \left( \frac{ \pi r_g }{L} \right)^2 \\
    &= \frac{ \pi^2 (400 \times 10^{-8}) }{ (12 \times 10^{-6})(73 \times 10^{-4})(10^2)}\\
    &= 4.51^{\circ} \text{ C}
   \end{aligned}
\end{gather*}

As we can see it requires very slight temperature change to cause
buckling. However, with a proper installation technique called \emph{rail
stressing}, the rail is pre-stretched before installation. This
technique preloads the rail in tension and thus it will be much less
likely to buckle.

\section{Summary}
\label{summary-3}
In this chapter, we study various ways engineering materials can fail.
The first two, yield/fracture and fatigue are due to damage inflicted to
the material by stress. Buckling, on the other hand, is due to the
geometric instability of the structure brought upon by external
compressive loads.

For yield and fracture, failure is due to static load. Yield occurs
usually in ductile materials, while fracture occurs in brittle
materials. The criteria introduced can be used to determine 'equivalent'
stress to determine whether yield or fracture will occur in case of
multiaxial stress.

Fatigue is due to repeated or periodic loading. The size of the load
itself is not sufficiently large to cause yield or fracture to the
material immediately, but after several cycles, the cumulative damage
can cause failure. We have derived equations relative the stress
amplitude to the number of cycles before failure, which also depends on
material properties and whether the average stress is zero.

Buckling occurs because the internal bending moment in the beam is not
enough to counter the external bending moment caused by the axial
compressive load if a slight lateral perturbation occurs. The critical
axial load depends on the dimensions of the body, material properties,
and support conditions.

\chapter{Design of Simple Load Bearing Elements}
\label{design-of-simple-load-bearing-elements}
Load bearing elements are designed to support forces, moments, or
torques and transfer them to their intended destination. A beam
typically supports a vertical load using its bending stiffness and
transfer the load to a wall or column. A column takes a vertical load
and transmit it to the foundation---as in a building or a structure. The
main purpose of a shaft is to transfer torque about its longitudinal
axis to a support or a rotational member.

The goal of this chapter is to develop the fundamental concepts involved
in designing load bearing elements to properly resist their respective
loads under given constraints.

\section{Basis for Beam Design}
\label{basis-for-beam-design}
Beams are often designed based on their strength so that they can resist
internal bending moment and shear force developed along their length.
Though it is arguable that some beams are also subjected to axial load
in operation, the resultant stress from such loads are typically
negligible compared to those from bending moment and shear force. It is
also assumed that the beam material is homogeneous and has linear
elastic behavior. We have discussed the formulas that establish the
relationship between bending moment and normal stress and shear force
and shear stress in \hyperref[section: bending]{3.5}.

Although beams are mostly design for strength, they must be braced along
their sides in certain cases to provide additional stability and prevent
buckling. Furthermore, in some cases beams must be designed to resist a
limited amount of deflection, such as when they support ceilings made of
brittle materials. Methods for finding deflections are discussed in
\hyperref[subsection: beam deflection]{3.5.8}, and beam buckling is discussed
in details in \hyperref[section: buckling]{4.3}.

The beam bending and shear stress formulas are employed to for beam
design; we will discuss the resultant stress of a cantilever beam when
these two formulas are applied at various point along the length,
assuming that the beam has a rectangular cross section and supports a
load P at the free end.

In general, shear stress distribution in a beam takes a parabolic shape,
while normal stress distribution takes a linear shape, shown in
[[\#fig: stress in beam]\ref{fig: stress in beam}]. Notice that the top and
bottom parts of the beam only take normal stress, while the middle part
only takes shear stress. Any other region of the beam takes a
combination of normal and shear stresses.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Simple-load-bearing/stress-in-beam.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig: stress in beam}
Shear and normal stress distributions in a cantilever beam.}
\end{figure}

At each point, the state of stress can be transformed into principal
stresses. The results are shown in
[[\#fig: stress traject in beam]\ref{fig: stress traject in beam}]. Notice
that on the right column, the element undergoes a counterclockwise
rotation, from \(0^{\circ}\) at the top, to \(45^{\circ}\) in the middle, to
\(90^{\circ}\) at the bottom.


throughout its thickness
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Simple-load-bearing/stress-traject-beam.pdf}
\label{fig: stress traject in beam}
\end{center}

If this analysis is expanded to other vertical cross sections throughout
the length of the beam, the results can be represented by sets of curves
called stress trajectories. Each of these lines represents the direction
of a principal stress having a constant magnitude. Some of these
trajectories are shown in Figure 5.3. In this figure, the solid lines
represent the direction of the tensile principal stresses and the dashed
lines represent the direction of the compressive principal stresses. The
lines intersect the neutral axis at \(45^{\circ}\) and the solid and dashed
lines intersect at \(90^{\circ}\) because principal stresses are always
\(90^{\circ}\) apart. Knowing these trajectories can help engineers
determine where to reinforce a beam especially if the beam is made of
brittle material so that it will not crack or become unstable.

\section{Prismatic Beam Design}
\label{prismatic-beam-design}
Most beams are made of ductile materials. When this is the case, it is
generally unnecessary to plot stress trajectories. It is typically
sufficient to make sure that the bending and shear stresses in the beam
do not exceed allowable values. In most cases, the suspended section of
the beam will be relatively long, so that the internal bending moments
are large. With large bending moments, the first design concern is the
normal bending stress, then shear stress. To control the normal stress,
the beam must have sufficient section modulus. Following
[[\#eqn: section modulus]\ref{eqn: section modulus}], we have that the
required section modulus of a beam with maximum bending moment
\(M_{\max}\) and allowable stress \(\sigma_{allow}\) is

$$S_{req} = \frac{M_{\max}}{\sigma_{allow}}$$

It is important to note that the beam is assumed to be light so that its
weight does not contribute significantly to the bending moment. If we do
not make such assumption, the actual section modulus should be slightly
larger than \(S_{req}\). Once the section modulus is known, if the beam
has a simple cross section like a square, a rectangle, or a circle, then
its dimensions can be determined promptly since \(S = I/c\). However, if
the section is a complex shape or made up of several elements, there may
be an infinite number of combinations that satisfy the value of
\(S_{req}\). In reality, engineers choose a particular beam meeting the
section modulus requirement from a handbook or catalog that lists
available standard shapes from manufacturers. If deflection is not a
concern, then the beam with the smallest cross-sectional area (which is
also the lightest and most economical) is chosen. If there is a
constrain on deflection \(\delta_{allow}\), however, a generalized beam
deflection equation can be used to determine the required moment of
inertia \(I_{req}\).

$$I_{req} = k \frac{FL^3}{E \delta_{allow}}$$

where the constant \(k\) depends on the location of load \(F\) along the
beam and support conditions.

Once the beam has been selected, engineers can use the shear-stress
formula \(\tau_{allow} = VQ/Ib\) to check for excessive shear stress.
Typically this is not a problem. However, in cases where the beam is
short, thick, and supporting a large concentrated load, this shear
stress limitation may dictate the size of the beam. This is especially
important for wooden beams as they are prone to failure along the grain
due to shear.

\section{Fabricated Beams}
\label{fabricated-beams}
Since beams are often made of steel or wood, we will discuss some of the
tabulated properties of beams made from these materials.

\subsection{Steel sections}
\label{steel-sections}
Most manufactured steel beams are made by the process of rolling hot
steel into a desired shape of cross section. These rolled shapes have
properties that have been tabulated in the American Institute of Steel
Construction (AISC) manual. The properties of wide-flange (W shape),
channel (C shape), and angle members are listed in
\hyperref[appendix: structural steel properties]{2}. For example, a W610
\(\times\) 155 indicates a wide-flanged cross section having a depth of
610 mm and a weight of 155 kg/m. For any given section, the weight per
length, dimensions, cross-sectional area, moment of inertia, section
modulus, and the radius of gyration are reported. Notice that in
structural steel sections, the tables will report the properties
according to its neutral axis. We must use the beam along the axis which
can resist the highest stress and deflection.


\hspace{1cm}
\hspace{1cm}
\hspace{1cm}
To choose a proper steel section, we follow the same process as any
prismatic beam design. Determine the required section modulus \(S_{req}\)
and moment of inertia \(I_{req}\) from the stress and deflection
requirement, respectively. Subsequently, the optimal section can be
selected on minimum weight or minimum cost criterion.

A gantry crane with 3-m span has a maximum load capacity of 3 ton.
Determine a proper structural steel (S shape) so that the safety factor
is 3 and the maximum deflection does not exceed 1 cm.


\url{pictures/Simple-load-bearing/gantry-crane}

In this problem, first of all, we must make sure that the designed beam
does not fail under the 3-ton load regardless of the weight position on
the crane. With the beam supported on both ends, the maximum bending
moment occur when the load is hoisted from the middle. The corresponding
bending moment is \(M = FL / 4\) and the required section modulus
\(S_{req}\) is

$$\begin{aligned}
    S_{req} &= \frac{N_s M}{S_y} \\
            &= \frac{(3)(3000)(10)(3)/4}{250 \times 10^6} \\
            &= 2.7 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^3 = 2.7 \times 10^5 \text{ mm}^3
  \end{aligned}$$

Refering to [[\#table: s-shaped sections]\ref{table: s-shaped sections}],
the proper section is S250 \(\times\) 37.8.

The problem also specified the maximum deflection, which also occurs in
the middle of the beam when there is a midpoint load. The expression for
the deflection of a beam with simple supports is

$$\begin{aligned}
    \delta &= \frac{FL^3}{48EI_{req}} \\
    I_{req} &= \frac{30000(3^3)}{48(210 \times 10^9)(0.01)} \\
           &= 8.04 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^4 = 8.04 \times 10^6 \text{ mm}^4
  \end{aligned}$$

Using the same table, the proper section is S150 \(\times\) 18.6.

Finally, we see that the \(S_{req}\) requires a larger section, and should
be our designed beam.

\subsection{Wood sections}
\label{wood-sections}
Most wooden beams have rectangular cross sections because they are easy
to manufacture and handle. Manuals list the dimensions of lumber often
used in beam design. Lumber is identified by its nominal dimensions, for
example 2 \(\times\) 4. However, its actual dimensions are smaller (1.5
\(\times\) 3.5) because lumber must be further processed to obtain a
smooth surface. The actual dimensions, of course, must be used when
calculating stresses in a wooden beam.

\subsection{Built-up sections}
\label{built-up-sections}
A built-up section is made from two or more parts joined together. Since
the ability of a beam to resist moment depends on its section modulus,
which in turn depends on its moment of inertia, beam material should be
placed as far away as possible from its neutral axis. This is what makes
wide-flanged beam so effective in resisting bending moment with minimal
weight.

For very large loads, however, there may not be a beam with a
sufficiently large section modulus. Engineers often "build up" a beam
made of plates and angles. A beam with deep I-shaped cross section made
from built-up plates and angles are called a plate girder where angles
are either bolted or welded to plates forming I-shape, illustrated in
[[\#fig: steel fabricated beam]\ref{fig: steel fabricated beam}].


angles
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Simple-load-bearing/steel-fab-beams.pdf}
\label{fig: steel fabricated beam}
\end{center}

Wooden beams can also be built-up, usually form a box beam section. For
larger spans, glulam beams, made from glue-laminating multiple boards
together to form a thick rectangular section, can be used.

Just as in the case of rolled steel or wooden sections made from a
single piece, built-up beams must be checked so that their bending and
shear stresses do not exceed the allowable values of any of the parts.
Additionally, the stress of the fasteners (welds, bolts, or glue) must
also be checked to prevent the beams from coming apart.

\section{Fully Stressed Beams}
\label{fully-stressed-beams}
Since the moment in a beam generally varies along its length, prismatic
beams are not usually the most efficient choice for resisting moment
since it is never fully stressed where the moment is smaller than the
maximum moment in the beam. In order to reduce weight, engineers
sometimes choose a variable cross-sectioned beam in such a way that at
each cross section along the beam, the bending stress reaches its
maximum allowable value. Beams having a variable cross section are
called nonprismatic beams. They are often used in machines since they
can be formed by casting. They can also be built-up using plates or
angles to reinforce the location where the bending moment or shear force
is expected to be the highest.

The stress analysis of a nonprismatic beam is typically very
complicated. In most cases, analyses are carried out with a computer.
The results obtained, however, does indicate that the assumptions used
in the flexure formula are approximately correct for predicting bending
stresses in nonprismatic beams provided that the rate of change of the
cross section is not too severe. On the other hand, the shear formula
cannot be used for nonprismatic beams since the results can be very
misleading.

Though caution is advised when designing beams using the flexure
formula, we can see that by applying
[[\#eqn: flexure formula]\ref{eqn: flexure formula}] the general shape of
the beam can be determined. The only difference is that \(S_{req}\) is now
a function of the position along the length of the beam. A beam designed
this way is called a fully stressed beam. It is important to note that
only the bending stress is considered here, and shear stress must be
carefully checked in its final shape, especially at the locations of
concentrated loads.

Determine the cross section of a fully stressed, rectangular
cross-sectioned cantilever beam with a downward load at the free end.

For a cantilever beam of length \(L\) that is fixed on the left end, the
bending moment as a function of position along the length is

$$M(x) = F(x-L)$$

Assume that the base and thickness of the beam as functions of length
are \(b(x)\) and \(h(x)\), respectively. We can rewrite
[[\#eqn: beam required section]\ref{eqn: beam required section}] as

$${\renewcommand{1.2}{2.5}
  \begin{array}{l}
    S_{req} = \dfrac{M(x)}{\sigma_{allow}} = \dfrac{F(x-L)}{\sigma_{allow}} \\
    \dfrac{b(x)h(x)^2}{6} = \dfrac{F(x-L)}{\sigma_{allow}} \\
    b(x)h(x)^2 = \dfrac{6F(x-L)}{\sigma_{allow}}
  \end{array}}$$

This function \(bh^2 = 6F(x-L)/\sigma_{allow}\) determines the general
cross-sectional shape along the beam length. Being a two-variable
function, it does not provide us with the sense of what that shape is.
We can, however, set one variable as a constant and obtain the shape
described by the other.

First, let us set \(h\) as a constant, the required base length \(b\)
becomes

$$b(x) = \dfrac{6F(x-L)}{h^2 \sigma_{allow}}$$

With all other variables set to constants, \(b(x)\) is simply a linear
function along the beam length, i.e. the beam forms a wedge.


\url{pictures/Simple-load-bearing/fully-stressed-wedge}

If instead, \(b\) is set as a constant, the required thickness of the beam
is

$$h(x) = \sqrt{\dfrac{6F(x-L)}{b \sigma_{allow}}}$$

\(h\) in this case is a parabola.


\url{pictures/Simple-load-bearing/fully-stressed-parabola}

\section{Shaft Design}
\label{shaft-design}
Shafts with circular cross sections are the staple of machine design.
They are used to transfer torque and set alignment to rotational
components. As such, they are usually subjected to cyclic loading and
fatigue stress, caused by the torsional and bending loads they must
transfer or resist. In addition to these loads, various components and
features such as keys, couplings, or sudden changes in cross-sectional
area of the shaft can cause stress concentrations. To properly design a
shaft, all of these considerations must be taken into account.

In this section, we will discuss the important aspects of the design of
shafts required for power transmission. These shafts are subjected to
loads transferred from attached pulleys or gears. Since the loads
applied to the shaft can come from many angles, the internal bending and
torsional moments at any cross section can be determined by breaking for
loads down into their Cartesian components. With that, equilibrium
equations can be written from the loads in each plane, and the resultant
moment can then be determined using vector addition. In addition,
segments of the shaft can be subjected to different torques, which can
be addressed by constructing a \emph{torque diagram}. Also, if there exist
any axial loading on the shaft, either due to external load or due to
attached angled worms or gears, the resultant axial stress must be
incorporated in the analysis as well

Once internal bending moment, torque, and axial load along the length of
the shaft have been determined, the next task is to determine the
critical point in the shaft---the location where the combination of
moment and torque causes the worst stress situation. Furthermore,
external forces can cause shear stresses from \(\tau = VQ/Ib\). In most
cases, however, these shear stresses are small compared to the stresses
due to bending and torsional moments. In general, the critical point is
subjected to plane stress so that


$$\sigma  = \frac{Mr}{I} + \frac{F}{A} \hspace{1cm} \tau  = \frac{Tr}{J}$$

If the allowable normal or shear stress for the material is known, we
can apply a corresponding theory of failure to determine the proper size
of the shaft. For example, if the shaft is ductile we can apply the
maximum shear stress theory, which requires that the maximum allowable
shear stress be equal to the maximum shear stress in the shaft. Using
stress transformation, we have that

$$\begin{gathered}
    \tau_{allow} = \tau_{\max} = \sqrt {\left( \frac{\sigma}{2} \right)^2 + {\tau ^2}}  \\ 
    = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{Mr}{2I} + \frac{F}{2A} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{Tr}{J} \right)^2}  \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

Since \(I = \pi r^4/4\) and \(J = \pi r^4/2\), the above equation becomes

$$\begin{gathered}
    \tau_{allow} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{2M}{\pi r^3} + \frac{F}{2 \pi r^2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{2T}{\pi r^3} \right)^2 } \\
    r = \left( \frac{1}{2 \pi \tau _{allow}} \sqrt {(4M + Fr)^2 + 16T^2 } \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
  \end{gathered}$$

If the shaft design calls for a safety factor \(N_s\), then the required
radius is

$$\begin{gathered}
  r = \left( \frac{N_s}{2 \pi \tau _{allow}} \sqrt {(4M + Fr)^2 + 16T^2} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}\end{gathered}$$

The above equation cannot be analytically solve, except when \(F=0\), in
which case

$$ r = \left( \frac{2 N_s}{\pi \tau_{allow}}\sqrt {M^2 + T^2} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$$

Note that the application of any other theories of failure or safety
factor other than one will result in a different value for the radius
\(r\). In more complex scenarios, it may be necessary to apply this
methodology to all possible candidates of a critical point to determine
the largest required radius.

A 1-m long shaft is fitted with a pully and timing belt. The tensions on
the slack and tight sides are 2000 N and 500 N respectively. The pulley
radius is 5 cm. Size the proper shaft size so that it has a safety
factor of 2.5. The shaft is made of AISI1023 with \(S_y\) = 400 MPa.


Upon inspection, this power transmission mechanism does not have any
helical or bevel gear that can exert axial load, so the shaft is
subjected to only bending and torsion. What we need to do here is to
determine the critical point location and corresponding stresses which
should lead us to the required shaft radius.

The shaft is supported by bearings on both sides, though it did not make
any mention about whether it is a fixed or simple support. Applied
torque in this problem does not depend on the type of support, while
bending moment may. However, when the applied load is in the middle of
the shaft like here, the type of support does not impact the bending
moment either.

We have seen bending problems with midpoint loads many times before, so
we know that the critical point is in the middle at the top of bottom
surface of the shaft. Shear stress from torsion is uniform on the
surface. The state of stress at the critical point reduces to

$$\sigma = \frac{Mr}{I}$$ $$\tau = \frac{Tr}{J}$$

in which case, the required shaft radius from
[[\#eqn: shaft radius without axial]\ref{eqn: shaft radius without axial}]
is

$$\begin{aligned}
    r &= \left( \frac{2 N_s}{\pi \tau _{allow}}\sqrt {M^2 +T^2}  \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \\
      &= \left( \frac{2 \times 2.5}{\pi (400 \times 10^6 /2 )}\sqrt {[(2000+500)(0.6/4)]^2 +[(2000-500)(0.05)]^2}  \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \\
      &= 1.51 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m} = 1.51 \text{ cm}
  \end{aligned}$$

Note that \(\tau_{allow}\) is derived from maximum shear stress theory,
for which \(\tau_{allow} = S_y/2\).

\section{Column Design}
\label{column-design}
In the previous sections, we discussed the design of members based on
strength and deflection by assuming that they are always in equilibrium
and stable. However, columns under axial compression can be subjected to
large enough load to cause it to buckle. This can often lead to a sudden
and dramatic failure of a structure or mechanism. Hence, special
attention must be given to the design of columns so that they can
support their intended loads without buckling.

\subsection{Design of simple columns}
\label{design-of-simple-columns}
Simple columns refer to prismatic columns with homogeneous materials and
ideal supports. The governing equations of these columns have already
been derived and discussed in details in \hyperref[section: buckling]{4.3}.
Employing [[\#eqn: Euler's formula]\ref{eqn: Euler's formula}], we have
that the critical load for a column is

$$P_{cr} = \frac{\pi ^2EI}{(KL)^2}$$

where \(K\) is a constant based on the column supports. For a given column
length \(L\) and a given column material, its moment of inertia \(I\) is

$$I_{req} = \frac{P_{cr}(KL)^2}{\pi ^2E}$$

The cross section dimensions can then be easily determined once its
shape is selected. For example, considering columns with circular cross
sections. The required radius is

$$r_{req} = \left( \frac{4I_{req}}{\pi } \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}$$

Similar derivations can be used to compute dimensions for columns with
square or rectangular (with known width-to-height ratio) cross sections.

\subsection{Design of columns for concentric loading}
\label{subsection: column concentric loading}
The theory presented in the previous section applies to columns that are
perfectly straight, made of homogeneous material, and originally stress
free. In reality, none of these conditions can practically be met. Also,
column supports are hardly ideal, and load applications are even less
so. To compensate for these imperfections, many design codes require the
use of formulas based on empirical data. By performing large numbers of
experiments, the results can be plotted and design formulas can be
determined using curve fitting.

In order to account for the behavior of columns with different lengths,
design codes usually give formulas that will best fit the data within
the short, medium, and long column range. Each formula will only apply
to a certain range of slenderness ratio. Examples of design formulas for
steel, aluminum, and wood columns that are currently in use will be
discussed. It is important to note that these formulas should not be
used for the design of actual columns unless the codes from which they
are referenced is used.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Steel columns
\label{steel-columns}
Columns made of structural steel can be designed on the basis of
formulas proposed by the Structural Stability Research Council (SSRC).
Safety factors have been applied to these formulas and adopted as
specifications for building construction by the American Institute of
Steel Construction (AISC). These specifications give two formulas for
column design, which give the maximum allowable stress in the column for
a specific range of slenderness ratio.

For long columns, the Euler's
formula--[[\#eqn: Euler's formula]\ref{eqn: Euler's formula}]--is proposed

$$\sigma_{\max} = \frac{\pi^2E}{\lambda^2}$$

where \(\lambda = KL/r_g\) is the slenderness ratio and \(r_g\) is the
radius of gyration of the column cross section. The application of this
formula requires the safety factor of 23/12 = 1.92 so that

$$\sigma_{allow} = \frac{12\pi^2E}{23\lambda^2} \hspace{1cm} \lambda_c \leqslant \lambda \leqslant 200$$

This equation is applicable for the slenderness ratio between 200 and
\(\lambda_c\). This latter value is there to prevent the material reaching
inelastic region. Experiments show that compressive residual stress can
exist in rolled steel sections for an upward amount of one-half of the
yield strength. Therefore, if the compressive stress in the material is
more than one-half the yield strength, the material will be in the
inelastic region and the formulas no longer apply. The value of
\(\lambda_c\) is therefore

$$\begin{gathered}
  \frac{S_y}{2} = \frac{\pi ^2E}{\lambda_c^2} \hfill \\
  \lambda_c = \sqrt {\frac{2\pi^2E}{S_y}}  \hfill \end{gathered}$$

Columns having slenderness ratio less than \(\lambda_c\) are designed on
the basis of an empirical formula that has the form

$$\sigma _{\max} = \left[ 1 - \frac{\lambda^2}{2\lambda_c^2} \right]S_y$$

There is more uncertainty for longer columns, and the safety factor must
reflect this. It takes the form

$$N_s = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{3\lambda}{8\lambda_c} - \frac{\lambda^3}{8\lambda_c^3}$$

Note that the safety factor is 5/3 = 1.67 when \(\lambda\) = 0 and
increases to 23/12 = 1.92 when \(\lambda = \lambda_c\). Therefore, for
design purpose

$$\sigma_{allow} = \frac{\sigma_{\max}}{N_s} = \frac{\left[ 1 - \dfrac{\lambda^2}{2\lambda_c^2} \right] S_y }{\dfrac{5}{3} + \dfrac{ 3\lambda }{8\lambda_c} - \dfrac{\lambda^3}{8\lambda_c^3}}$$


Determine a proper cross section of a structural wide-flange steel beam
(W-shape) for a gantry crane. The column is to take a compressive load
of 50000 N and is to be 3 m tall. The safety factor of the column is 2.
Consider the top part free and the bottom part fixed. Use these methods
to determine the proper cross-sectional moment of inertia.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ideal column assumption.

\item AISC equation.
\end{enumerate}

Compare and discuss the results.

For relatively long and slender columns, the only concern about choosing
a proper cross-section is preventing buckling. For a fixed-free column,
the effective length factor \(K = 2\). In that case, we need to determine
the minimum required moment of inertia \(I_{req}\).

Using ideal column assumptions, the critical load of a column is

$$\begin{aligned}
    P_{cr} &= \frac{\pi^2 EI}{4L^2}
  \end{aligned}$$

Incorporating safety factor, we can determine \(I_{req}\) as

$$\begin{aligned}
    N_s &= \frac{P_{cr}}{P} \\
    I &= I_{req} = \frac{4 N_s P L^2}{\pi^2 E} \\
        &= \frac{4(2)(50000)(3^2)}{\pi^2 (210 \times 10^9)} \\
        &= 3.47 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^4
  \end{aligned}$$

Refering to the catalog for W-shape steel, the proper section is W360
\(\times\) 39.

Now, using the AISC equation, there is no analytical relationship for us
to solve for the required \(I\) or \(r_g\). Instead, we must use the
equation to calculate allowable load on each cross section. The
generated allowable load data table is

 L2.5cm C2cm C2cm C2cm C2cm C2cm W section \& \(r_g\) (mm) \& \(A\) (mm\(^2\)) \&
Slenderness Ratio \& \(\sigma_{allow}\) (MPa) \& \(P_{allow}\) (kN)\\
W360 \(\times\) 39 \& 27.5 \& 4960 \& 218 \& -63 \& -314\\
W360 \(\times\) 45 \& 37.8 \& 5710 \& 159 \& 32 \& 183\\
W200 \(\times\) 36 \& 40.9 \& 4570 \& 147 \& 46 \& 211\\
W150 \(\times\) 22 \& 36.8 \& 2860 \& 163 \& 26.6 \& 76\\

At first, we find that our original choice W360 \(\times\) 39 does not
have the proper slenderness ratio (218 was higher than 200). So we pick
a next larger one, W360 \(\times\) 45, but find that it can support much
larger load than required. Subsequently, by process of elimination, we
find the lightest section that still support sufficient compressive load
is the W150 \(\times\) 22.

\item Aluminum columns
\label{aluminum-columns}
Column design for structural aluminum is specified by the Aluminum
Association using three equations, each applicable to a specific range
of slenderness ratios. Since several types of aluminum alloy exist,
there is a unique set of formulas for each type. For a common alloy
(2014-T6) used in building construction, the formulas are

$$\sigma_{allow} = \left\{
    \begin{array}{lcc}
      1.93 \times 10^8 &&  0 \leqslant \lambda \leqslant 12 \\[20pt] 
      2.12 \times 10^8 - 1.59 \times 10^6 \lambda && 12 \leqslant \lambda \leqslant 55 \\[20pt]
      \dfrac{3.72 \times 10^{11}}{ \lambda^2 } && 55 \leqslant \lambda 
    \end{array} \right.$$

Again, in these design equations, \(\lambda = KL/r_g\). Notice that the
first two parts are linear, used to model the effects of short and
medium columns. The third has the same form as the Euler formula and is
used for long columns.


\item Timber Columns
\label{timber-columns}
Columns used in timber construction are designed based on formulas
published by the National forest Products Association (NFPA) or the
American Institute of Timber Construction (AITC). For example, the NFPA
formulas for the allowable in short, intermediate, and long columns have
a rectangular cross section of dimensions \(b\) and \(h\), where \(h\) is the
smallest dimension of the cross section, are

$$\sigma_{allow} = \left\{
    \begin{array}{l c}
      8.27 \times 10^6 & 0 \leqslant \lambda \leqslant 11 \\ 
      8.27 \times 10^6\left[ 1 - \dfrac{1}{3} \left( \dfrac{\lambda}{26} \right)^2 \right] & 11 \leqslant \lambda \leqslant 26 \\ 
      \dfrac{3.72 \times 10^9}{\lambda^2} & 26 \leqslant \lambda \leqslant 50 
    \end{array} \right.$$

The slenderness ratio for a timber column is \(\lambda = KL/h\). The wood
in this example has a Young's modulus of 12.4 GPa and an allowable
compressive stress of 8.27 MPa parallel to the grain. In particular the
last equation in is simply Euler's equation with a safety factor of 3.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Design of columns for eccentric loading}
\label{design-of-columns-for-eccentric-loading}
Occasionally a column is required to support a load acting at its edge
or, more generally, an off-centroid load. In this case, the load will
generate a bending moment which must be accounted for when the column is
designed. There are several acceptable ways this can be accomplished. We
will discuss two such methods in this section.


\begin{enumerate}
\item Use of available column formula
\label{use-of-available-column-formula}
The stress distribution over the cross section of the beam can be
determined by superposition of the resultant stresses: the axial stress
from the compressive load and the bending stress from the bending
moment. In this case, the maximum compressive stress is

$${\sigma_{\max}} = \frac{P}{A} + \frac{{My}}{I}$$

This stress can then be compared to the allowable stress using the
formulas given in section 5.6.2. The allowable stress should be
calculated using the largest slenderness ratio regardless of the axis
about which the column experiences bending, and should lead to a
conservative design in most cases. If the maximum stress is lower than
the allowable stress then the design is acceptable. If not, the cross
sectional area must be increased and the stress must be re-checked. This
method works well for \emph{short} and \emph{intermediate} columns.

\item Interaction Formula
\label{interaction-formula}
This method takes into account the interaction between the axial and
bending loads in order to design a column that would balance the two. To
do this, separate contributions to column cross-sectional area by the
axial force and bending moment are considered. If the allowable stress
for the axial load is \((\sigma_a)_{allow}\), then the cross-sectional
area required to support an axial force \(P\) is

$$A_a = \frac{P}{(\sigma_a)_{allow}}$$

Similarly, if the allowable bending stress is \((\sigma_b)_{allow}\), and
since \(I = Ar_g^2\) the required cross-sectional area to support the
bending moment \(M\) is

$$A_b = \frac{My}{(\sigma _b)_{allow}r_g^2}$$

The total area \(A\) required to resist both the axial load and the
bending moment is

$$\label{eqn: interaction formula}
  \begin{gathered}
    A_a + A_b = \dfrac{P}{(\sigma_a)_{allow}} + \frac{My}{(\sigma _b)_{allow}r_g^2} \leqslant A \\ 
    \text{or} \\ 
    \dfrac{P/A}{(\sigma_a)_{allow}} + \dfrac{Mc/Ar_g^2}{(\sigma_b)_{allow}} \leqslant 1 \\ 
    \dfrac{\sigma _a}{(\sigma_a)_{allow}} + \dfrac{\sigma_b}{(\sigma_b)_{allow}} \leqslant 1 \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

Note that \((\sigma_a)_{allow}\) is the allowable stress for compression
for a specific material or design code (such as ones given in
\hyperref[subsection: column concentric loading]{1.6.2}) and
\((\sigma_b)_{allow}\) is the allowable bending stress for a specific
material or design code.

shows the interaction and contribution of each type of load to the
required cross sectional area. This design method requires a
trial-and-error process by picking a cross section and check whether
inequality is satisfied. If not, the next larger cross section is picked
and the process repeats. The most economical choice is the one that
gives the left side of the inequality closest to but less than 1.

This interaction method is often specified in design codes for steel,
aluminum, and timber. Particularly, for allowable stress design, the
AISC specifies the use of this equation only when the axial stress ratio
\(\sigma_a / (\sigma_a)_{allow} \leq 0.15\).

Design of a gantry crane column

A gantry crane with a 4-m long horizontal beam is supported on each end
by a 3-m long single column. The crane is supposed to support a maximum
weight of 5 ton. Determine the proper section to use. Refer to S-shaped
steel from \hyperref[appendix: structural steel properties]{2}.

F = 50000 L = 4 M = F*L/4 Ns = 3

In this example, the proper section will give the sum of stress ratios

Design of a luffing crane

A crane is a type of machine mainly used to lift, lower, and
horizontally move heavy objects. It is immensely useful in construction
works. In this problem, we will be analyzing a type of crane called a
\emph{luffing crane}.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Simple-load-bearing/tower-crane2.pdf}
\caption{\label{tower crane}
a typical luffing crane}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in [[\#tower crane]\ref{tower crane}], a luffing crane
typically consists of a main mast, a jib, a gantry and a counterweight.
The jib and the gantry are \emph{always} perpendicular, but the jib can vary
in angle with the horizontal line. In this problem, however, we will
consider it fixed at 30\(^{\circ}\). The counterweight is pulling directly
downward on the end of the gantry, which is also connected to the end of
the jib by a cable. The gantry is pinned to the top of the main mast.

In reality, the main mast and jib are made of multiple short columns and
beams welded together into a compound structure. For this problem,
however, we will assume that the mast and jib are each made of a single
constant cross-section steel. The steel has \(E\) = 210 GPa, \(S_y\) = 400
MPa, and \(S_{ut}\) = 550 MPa.

In this problem, the main mast is 10 m long, the jib is 20 m long, and
the gantry is 6 m long. The counterweight weighs 20000 N. The angle
\(\theta = 30^{\circ}\). The maximum weight that the crane can lift is
10000 N. The safety factors of the mast and the jib are 2 and 3,
respectively. The jib can be considered fixed to the mast, while the
mast base is fixed to the ground and free to move at the top.

Determine the required section modulus \(S_{mast}\) and \(S_{jib}\) and
moments of inertia \(I_{mast}\) and \(I_{jib}\) of the mast and the jib.
Ignore fatigue and stress concentration factors. You may assume that the
mast, jib, and gantry are weightless.

First order of business, we need to determine the load on the mast and
the jib. Using free body diagrams, let us first start off with the
gantry.

On the gantry, since it is pinned to the mast, the only load from the
top of the mast is along the length of the gantry. Consider balance of
moments about the pinned joint, we have

$$\begin{aligned}
    20000(6 \sin 30^{\circ}) &= T \left( 6 \frac{20}{\sqrt{ 20^2 +6^2 }} \right) \\
    T &= 20880 \text{ N}
  \end{aligned}$$

The cable tension is 20880 N. We can find the moment applied at the
fixed joint of the jib and the mast.

$$\begin{aligned}
    M_{jib} &= 20880 \left( \frac{6}{\sqrt{20^2 + 6^2}} \right) (20) - 10000(20 \cos 30^{\circ}) \\
            &= -53208 \text{ N-m}
  \end{aligned}$$

The bending moment the mast exerts on the jib is 53208 N-m
(counterclockwise).

We can also determine the axial load in the jib, which is

$$\begin{aligned}
    F_{jib} &= 20880 \left( \frac{20}{\sqrt{20^2 + 6^2}} \right) + 10000 \sin 30^{\circ} \\
            &= 25000 \text{ N}
  \end{aligned}$$

We can determine the required \(I_{jib}\) and \(S_{jib}\) now that we know
the moments and load applied to the jib.

The \(S_{jib}\) is determined by the stress requirement. The maximum
stress in the jib is at the bottom surface where the compressive bending
stress and compressive axial stress combine. We have

$$\begin{aligned}
    N_s &= \frac{S_y}{\sigma_{axial} + \sigma_{bending}} \\
    3 &= \frac{400 \times 10^6}{\dfrac{25000}{A_{jib}} + \dfrac{53208}{S_{jib}}} \\[1ex]
    S_{jib} &= \frac{53208}{133 \times 10^6 - \dfrac{25000}{A_{jib}}}
  \end{aligned}$$

The \(I_{jib}\) can be determined by the safety factor for buckling. We
have

$$\begin{aligned}
    N_s &= \frac{P_{cr}}{P} \\
    3 &= \frac{ \pi^2 E I_{jib} }{ (2(20))^2 25000 } \\
    I_{jib} &= 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^4
  \end{aligned}$$

Now, the axial load in the mast can be easily determined. It is simply
equal to the sum of all the external load = 20000 + 10000 = 30000 N
(compressive).

The only external moment applied to the mast is from the jib, and so the
moment on the mast is equal and opposite to the moment on the jib =
53208 N-m (clockwise). The critical point is on the right side of the
mast where compressive stresses from bending and axial load combine.

The \(S_{mast}\) and \(I_{mast}\) can be found in similar fashion.

$$\begin{aligned}
    N_s &= \frac{S_y}{\sigma_{axial} + \sigma_{bending}} \\
    2 &= \frac{400 \times 10^6}{\dfrac{30000}{A_{mast}} + \dfrac{53208}{S_{mast}}} \\
    S_{mast} &= \frac{53208}{200 \times 10^6 - \dfrac{30000}{A_{mast}}} 
  \end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
    N_s &= \frac{P_{cr}}{P} \\
    2 &= \frac{ \pi^2 E I_{mast} }{ (2(10))^2 30000 } \\
    I_{mast} &= 1.16 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^4
  \end{aligned}$$

Note that the problem did not indicate the cross section shape of the
mast and jib. If it did, the section moduli \(S_{jib}\) and \(S_{mast}\) can
be solve analytically. On the other hand, the moments of inertia
\(I_{jib}\) and \(I_{mast}\) can be solved without that information.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary}
\label{summary-4}
This chapter discusses the design criteria for simple load-bearing
members---namely beams (for bending loads), shafts (for torques), and
columns (for compressive loads). These are important building blocks for
mechanical designs. They bear weights, transfer torques, and provide
structural strength to parts. Fully understanding different types of
loads and resultant state of stresses are keys to well-designed load
bearing elements. A designer must also take care to examine risks for
various types of failure a member may undergo, examine the most likely
type of failure of that component, and properly design to mitigate it.

\section{Exercises}
\label{exercises-4}

[lab:\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{exercisesi}] A
footbridge is made of a series of columns, rails, and planks. A
simplified section of the bridge is shown in
[[\#fig: footbridge exercise]\ref{fig: footbridge exercise}].

The columns, rails, and planks are all made of Rosewood, a brittle

ultimate compressive stress = 60 MPa. The columns are to be 3 m tall,
the rails are to be 10 m long, and the planks are 2 m long. All supports
can be considered simply supported or pinned. Assume that when a
pedestrian uses the bridge, both of his feet will be on only one plank
at a time, and that there will be only one pedestrian using the bridge
at any moment. The maximum allowable weight of a person to cross the
bridge is 2000 N and you may assume that the columns, rails, and planks
are weightless.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the type of deformation in each component when there is a
pedestrian using the bridge.

\item Draw a free body diagram of each component when there is a maximum
load applied to it. (Show the magnitudes and directions of the loads)

\item If the columns have circular cross sections, while the rails and
planks have square cross sections, determine the diameter of the
columns and the sizes of the cross section of the rails and planks so
that the safety factor of the columns, rails, and planks are 10, 5,
and 4, respectively. You may ignore fatigue failure.

\item If a child comes to play on this bridge everyday by jumping
repeatedly on the middle of a single plank, causing the maximum
downward load on the plank of 1500 N, recalculate the proper cross
section size of the plank so that the fatigue safety factor is 4.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Spring Design}
\label{spring-design}
Springs are elastic members that exert forces and torques and absorb
energy, which is usually stored and later released. Typically they are
made of metal, but can also be made from plastic for light loads. Even
blocks of rubber are in fact springs, as in automobile bumpers and
isolation mountings. There are also pneumatic springs of various types
which uses the elastic compressibility of gases. For applications
requiring compact springs providing very large forces with small
deflections, hydraulic springs are very effective.

The main concern in this chapter is with springs made of solid metals,
plastics, or composites. The following sections are concerned with
springs of common geometric forms.

Various applications require flexibility and load control that springs
provide. Springs come in many shapes and forms to provide forces and
moments. There are also specialized types of springs for very specific
applications. Here are some of the most prevalent ones in use.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Torsion bars: take axial twisting loads.

\item Helical springs: take tensile or compressive loads along the helix
axis.

\item Leaf or beam springs: rely on beam bending.

\item Torsion springs: rely on bending of coiled wires.
\end{enumerate}

These are by no means an exhaustive list, but this book's main focus
will be on these four as a starting point.

\section{Torsion Bar Springs}
\label{torsion-bar-springs}
Perhaps the simplest of all the spring forms is the torsion bar. Common
applications include part of automotive suspension springs and counter
balancing springs for car hoods and trunk lids. A typical torsion bar
spring suspension assembly is illustrated in
[[\#fig: torsion bar spring]\ref{fig: torsion bar spring}]. These spring
rely on elastic deformation under torsion to store and release strain
energy.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Spring-design/torsion-bar-spring.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig: torsion bar spring}
Torsion bar spring suspension system}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Torsion Bar Spring Stress and Deformation}
\label{torsion-bar-spring-stress-and-deformation}
In this case, the basic stress, angular deflection (or angle of twist),
and spring rates equations are

$$\begin{gathered}
    \tau  = \frac{Tr}{J} \hfill \\
    \phi  = \frac{TL}{GJ} \hfill \\
    k = \frac{T}{\phi} = \frac{GJ}{L} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

For a solid round rod of diameter \(d\), these become

$$\begin{gathered}
    \tau  = \frac{16T}{\pi d^3} \hfill \\
    \phi  = \frac{32TL}{\pi d^4G} \hfill \\
    k = \frac{\pi d^4G}{32L} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

\subsection{Torsion Bar Spring Materials}
\label{torsion-bar-spring-materials}
As expected, torsion bar springs--especially in automotive suspension
applications--tend to incur repeated loadings during operation. As such,
steels remain the staple material of choice due to their endurance
limits.

One of the most prevalent steels for torsion bar springs is AISI 8650H.
It has been annealed at 800\$\textsuperscript{\^{}}\(C and tempered at 500\)\textsuperscript{\^{}}\$C to
obtain its high strength and reasonable flexibility. Its properties are
as follows.

\begin{description}
\item[{Young's modulus}] 205 GPa

\item[{Shear modulus}] 80 GPa

\item[{Yield strength}] 1076 MPa

\item[{Ultimate tensile strength}] 1255 MPa
\end{description}

Torsion bar spring design for a pick-up truck

We want to design a torsion bar spring for a rear suspension of a
pick-up truck which has to carry the maximum load of 20000 N. At this
load, the chassis of the truck should not lower by more than 3 cm. The
bar is connected to the chassis by a 6-cm lever. The bar itself is 30 cm
long.

In reality, a torsion bar spring is connected to multiple component to
form a suspension system. All of these components will contribute the
the vertical deflection of the chassis. In this problem, however, we
will assume that the only source of vertical deflection comes from the
rotation of the lever connected to the end of the torsion bar spring.

To limit the vertical deflection to 3 cm, we must limit the angle of
twist of the torsion bar. We will use AISI 8650H for the spring
material.

$$\begin{aligned}
    \phi &= \frac{32TL}{\pi d^4 G} \\
    \frac{0.03}{0.06}  &= \frac{32(20000)(0.06)(0.3)}{\pi d^4 (80 \times 10^9)} \\
    d &= 1.74 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}
  \end{aligned}$$

We must also verify that the designed torsion bar will not fail due to
excessive shear stress. Therefore, we find the required spring diameter
for strength and compare it to the designed diameter.

Assuming that the torsion bar is in pure torsion, we find the maximum
shear stress in order to determine the stress amplitude for fatigue
analysis.

$$\begin{aligned}
    \tau  &= \frac{16T}{\pi d^3} \\
          &= \frac{16(20000)(0.06)}{\pi d^3} \\
          &= \frac{6111}{d^3}
  \end{aligned}$$

In pure torsion, the material is under pure shear. Using stress
transformation (or Mohr's circle) to determine the equivalent normal
stress, we have the maximum stress.

$$\begin{gathered}
    \sigma_{\max} = \tau = \frac{6111}{d^3}
  \end{gathered}$$

The minimum stress on the torsion bar spring is assumed to be zero, in
which case the stress amplitude and average stress are

$$\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_a &= \frac{6111/d^3 - 0}{2} = \frac{3056}{d^3} \\
    \sigma_m &= \frac{6111/d^3 + 0}{2} = \frac{3056}{d^3}
  \end{aligned}$$

Substituting these values into Soderberg relation, we can solve for the
required diameter for the assumed safety factor of 2.

$$\begin{gathered}
    \frac{\sigma_a}{S_e} + \frac{\sigma_m}{S_y} = \frac{1}{N_s} \\
    \frac{3056/d^3}{0.3(1255 \times 10^6)} + \frac{3056/d^3}{1076 \times 10^6} = \frac{1}{2} \\
    d = 2.80 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}
  \end{gathered}$$

In this problem, the diameter according to the stress requirement is the
larger one, and is our final design diameter.

\section{Helical Springs}
\label{helical-springs}
Helical springs employ the same principles as torsion bar springs, but
avoid the problem of size by winding the spring into helical coils.
Helical springs still operate mainly under torsion, however, their
stresses are different from their torsional bar counterparts because of
their geometry.

\subsection{Helical Spring Stress}
\label{helical-spring-stress}
Consider helical coil springs with relatively small helix angle and wire
diameter d, illustrated in
[[\#fig: helical spring geometry]\ref{fig: helical spring geometry}]. At
each end of the spring, external force F is applied along the axis of
the helix. In compression springs, this is accomplished by winding the
end coils with zero pitch and grinding the ends flat to insure uniformly
distributed load at end plates. In the tension spring, the end hooks are
formed to position the load along the axis.

\end{figure}

Regardless of where the cutting plane takes place, equilibrium
considerations require that the wire be subjected to (1) a transverse
shear force \(F\) and (2) a torque equal to \(FD/2\). The resultant shear
stress is

$$\begin{aligned}
  \tau  &= \tau_{shear} + \tau_{torsion} \\ 
        &= \frac{Tr}{J} + \frac{F}{A} \\\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
  &= \dfrac{\dfrac{FD}{2}\dfrac{d}{2}}{\dfrac{\pi}{2}\left( \dfrac{d}{2} \right)^4} + \dfrac{F}{\dfrac{\pi d^2}{4}} \\ 
  &= \frac{8FD}{\pi d^3} + \frac{4F}{\pi d^2} \end{aligned}$$

Note that the second term is relatively small.

However, because of the curvature of the coil, the torsional stress on
its surface is increased. The severity of this effect is greatest when
the spring index \(C\), defined as the ratio of mean coil diameter \(D\) to
wire diameter \(d\).

$$C = \frac{D}{d}$$

The first generally recognized analysis of the transverse shear and
curvature effects was published by A. M. Wahl in 1929. This analysis
involved the derivation of the equation for a factor Kw (now called Wahl
factor) by which the stress can be multiplied to give the total
resultant shear stress on the inside of the coil.

$$K_w = \frac{4C - 1}{4C - 4} + \frac{0.615}{C}$$

Another correction factor is derived by Bergstrasser, which provides a
simpler equation with relatively small errors (\(< 1\%\)).

$$K_b = \frac{4C + 2}{4C - 3}$$

These factors can be multiplied with the torsional shear stress term to
give the approximate resultant shear stress of the inside of the spring
coil. In this book, however, Bergstrasser will be used due to its
simpler expression.

$$\tau  = K_b\frac{8FD}{\pi d^3}$$

\subsection{Helical Spring Constant and Deflection}
\label{helical-spring-constant-and-deflection}
Derivation of spring deflection can be done using Castigliano's theorem.
By assuming that transverse shear contributes negligibly to the
deflection, only the torsional load is considered. According to the
theorem, we have

$$\delta  = \int_0^L \frac{T}{GJ}\left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial F} \right)dx$$

Substitute the values for each parameter and let \(N_a\) be the number of
active coils, we have

$$\begin{aligned}
  \delta  &= \int_0^{2\pi N_a} \left( \frac{32}{G\pi d^4} \right)\left( \frac{FD}{2} \right)\left( \frac{D}{2} \right)\left( \frac{D}{2}d\theta  \right) \\ 
          &= \frac{4FD^3}{\pi d^4G} \\ 
          &= \frac{8FD^3N_a}{d^4G}\end{aligned}$$

The spring constant or spring rate is the ratio between the axially
applied force and the deflection, which gives

\begin{gather}
\label{eqn: spring constant}
  k = \frac{F}{\delta} = \frac{d^4G}{8D^3N_a} \hfill \\
  \text{or} \hfill \\
  k = \frac{Gd}{8C^3N_a} \hfill \\ 
\end{gather}

\subsection{Analysis for Helical Compression Springs under Static Loading}
\label{analysis-for-helical-compression-springs-under-static-loading}
Helical springs are typically wound from wire of solid round cross
section. Although spring wire was formerly manufactured primarily in
certain gage diameters, it is now readily available in any desired size,
though manufacturers may only stock certain preferred sizes.

The basic concern when designing springs for static loading is to avoid
set, which is a long-term shortening of the spring under load. For
helical springs, set is directly related to maximum allowable shear
stress---shear stress that leads to yielding. As a general rule of
thumb, fewer than 2\% of springs will experience long-term set if the
shear stress is equal to 45\% of ultimate tensile strength for ferrous
spring, and 35\% for nonferrous and stainless steel springs.

$$\tau_{allow} \leqslant \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
       0.45 S_{ut} & \text{ferrous} \hfill \\ 
       0.35 S_{ut} & \text{nonferrous and stainless} 
     \end{array} \right.$$

Ultimate tensile stresses of wire materials have been experimentally
determined and formulated as follows.

$$S_{ut} = \frac{A}{d^m}$$

Special care must be taken when using
[[\#eqn: spring material strength]\ref{eqn: spring material strength}] in
conjunction with other equations for spring design. The units of
\(S_{ut}\), \(A\), and \(d\) in the equation are MPa-mm and mm, respectively.
So they must be converted to their correct units before using in other
SI-oriented equations presented elsewhere.

The values for \(A\) and exponent \(m\) for various wire materials are shown
in [[\#table: spring materials]\ref{table: spring materials}].

\subsection{End Designs of Helical Compression Springs}
\label{end-designs-of-helical-compression-springs}
In order to ensure that the resultant load coincides with the spring
axis, spring ends must be designed properly for their uses. This usually
involves grinding and squaring the ends to keep nearly a full turn of
wire in contact with end plates. These ground/squared coils do not
contribute to spring flexibility and are not counted as \emph{active coils}.
The exact numbers for different end conditions are illustrated in
[[\#table: spring end conditions]\ref{table: spring end conditions}]. Note
that the range (maximum deflection) of a spring regardless of its end
type is equal to \(np - nd\).

\subsection{Buckling Analysis of Helical Compression Springs}
\label{buckling-analysis-of-helical-compression-springs}
Coil springs loaded in compression behave just like columns and must be
considered for possible buckling. For columns, long and slender ones are
considered prone to buckling; similar criteria apply to spring--springs
with large free length and small coil diameter tend to buckle easily.
Buckling, of course, also depends on exerted axial load and end
conditions. In [[\#fig: spring buckling]\ref{fig: spring buckling}],
buckling stability of helical compression springs are shown.
Intuitively, springs with parallel ends are much less prone to buckling
than those with nonparallel ends. The \$x\$-axis indicates the stability
of the spring due to its geometry, while the \$y\$-axis implicitly
indicates the compressive load from the deflected length.

The governing equation for buckling stability can be written as

$$L_f < \frac{\pi D}{\alpha} \left[ \frac{2(E-G)}{2G+E} \right]^{1/2}$$

where

$$\alpha = \frac{KD}{L_f}$$

is the effective slenderness ratio, equivalent the same quantity for
column buckling. Table
[[\#table: spring buckling]\ref{table: spring buckling}] gives the value
\(K\) for different end conditions. Notice how the values are identical to
those of column buckling.

Observe the graph in [[\#fig: spring buckling]\ref{fig: spring buckling}]
that both curves appear to have \$x\$-axis asymptotes. These values are
very important; below these \(L_f/D\) ratios, springs will \emph{not} buckle
regardless of exerted deflection. For steels, this turns out to be

$$L_f < 2.63 \frac{D}{K}$$

For squared and ground ends between flat parallel surfaces \(K\) = 0.5 and
\(L_f < 5.26 D\).

\subsection{Design Procedure for Helical Compression Spring---Static Loading}
\label{design-procedure-for-helical-compression-springstatic-loading}
The two most basic requirements of a helical spring design are an
acceptable stress level and the desired spring rate. To minimize weight,
size, and cost, we usually design springs to the highest stress level
that will not result in significant long-term set. Stress is typically
considered first because it involves only \(D\) and \(d\).

In compression springs, there are two load-related design safety
measures. The first of which is that designers must ensure that the
spring will not fail during operation. While this seems like a general
enough guideline for not only compression springs, one must recall that
compression springs have hard stops, namely their solid lengths.
Additional load exerted beyond solid force is unlikely to increase the
torsional shear stress in the spring wire. This is also the reason
safety factors in compression springs are usually on the small side
(\(N_s \geq 1.2\)). The designers simply needs to ensure that the spring
torsional stress at solid length is less than its allowable shear
stress.

\begin{gather}
\label{eqn: spring allowable stress}
  N_s = \frac{\tau _s}{\tau _{allow}} \hfill \\
  N_s \geqslant 1.2 \hfill \\ 
\end{gather}

Applying equations for spring torsional shear
stress---[[\#eqn: spring torsional stress]\ref{eqn: spring torsional stress}]---and
wire allowable shear
stress---[[\#eqn: spring allowable stress]\ref{eqn: spring allowable stress}],
we have

$$\frac{\tau _{allow}}{N_s} = K\frac{8F_sD}{\pi d^3}$$

The second design safety measure is to prevent the spring from reaching
solid length. This is important in

\begin{enumerate}
\item keeping the spring from failure and

\item allowing smooth operation of the spring
\end{enumerate}

Once the spring reaches its solid length, it no longer behaves like a
spring but rather a tube whose stiffness is much higher. The designer
can prevent this by ensuring that the maximum compressive load applied
to the spring is less than its solid force.

$$\begin{gathered}
    F_{\max} < F_s \\ 
    F_s = F_{\max}(1 + \xi ) \\ 
    \xi  \geqslant 0.15 \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

Combining these two equations, we arrive at the final expression for
spring torsional stress.

$$\frac{\tau _{allow}}{N_s} = \frac{8KF_sD}{\pi d^3} = \frac{4C + 2}{4C - 3}\left[ \frac{8(1 + \xi )F_{\max }C}{\pi d^2} \right]$$

Rearranging and reassigning parameters, the equation can be solved for
spring index \(C\).

$$\begin{gathered}
    \alpha  = \frac{\tau_{allow}}{N_s} \\ 
    \beta  = \frac{8(1 + \xi )F_{\max}}{\pi d^2} \\ 
    C = \frac{2\alpha  - \beta }{4\beta} + \sqrt {\left( \frac{2\alpha  - \beta}{4\beta} \right)^2 - \frac{3\alpha}{4\beta}}  \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

In general, the stress requirement can be satisfied by many combinations
of \(D\) and \(d\), and the objective is to find one that best suits the
requirements of the particular problem. With \(D\) and \(d\) tentatively
selected, \(N_a\) is then determined on the basis of the required spring
rate using [[\#eqn: spring constant]\ref{eqn: spring constant}].

$$N_a = \frac{Gd^4}{8D^3k} = \frac{Gd}{8C^3k}$$

Finally, the free length of the spring is determined by what length will
give the desired clash allowance. If the resulting design is prone to
buckling, or if the spring does not fit into the available space,
another combination of \(D\) and \(d\) may be selected. If the spring comes
out too large or too heavy, a stronger material must be considered.

The process of helical compression spring design can be summarized by a
process flowchart illustrated in
[[\#fig: spring design flowchart]\ref{fig: spring design flowchart}]

The following general guidelines are provided for standard helical
spring designs for static loading.

$$\begin{gathered}
    4 \leqslant C \leqslant 12 \\ 
    3 \leqslant N_a \leqslant 15 \\ 
    N_s \geqslant 1.2 \\ 
    \xi  \geqslant 0.15 \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

The first inequality sets a range of spring index value for standard
helical springs; if the index is too small the spring must be coiled
extremely tight, too large and it is wound too loose. The second
inequality provides a rough standard number of active coils. The final
equation requires that the maximum compressive for the spring will take
must be smaller than the solid force.

Design of bicycle suspension and seat springs

Consider bicycle suspensions. The bike weighs 15 kg and its center of
mass (CM) is shown below. After a 70-kg rider sits on the seat, the
front suspension shrinks by 0.5 cm while the seat suspension shrinks by
1 cm. Determine the proper front and seat suspension springs. You may
assume that both springs are vertical (not slanted) during operation.

First, consider weight distribution in both springs without the rider.
Obviously, since no one is riding, there is no load on the seat spring.
On the front spring, we can determine the load using moment equilibrium
and taking the rear wheel as a fulcrum. The equilibrium equation gives

$$\begin{gathered}
      (0.4)(150) = F_f(1.2) \hfill \\
      F_f = 50 \text{ N} \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}$$

Now consider the weight distribution with the rider. Again, the rider is
sitting on top of the seat (and the seat spring), so his entire weight
is supported by the seat spring. So \(F_s\) = 700 N. The force in the
front spring can be determined by equilibrium, which gives

$$\begin{gathered}
      (0.2)(700) + (0.4)(150) = F_f(1.2) \hfill \\
      F_f = 167 \text{ N} \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}$$

We can derive the required stiffness of each spring by combining the
derived change in force and the prescribed deflection.

$$\begin{gathered}
      k_f = \frac{167 - 50}{0.005} = 23400 \text{ N/m} \hfill \\
      k_s = \frac{700 - 0}{0.01} = 70000 \text{ N/m} \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}$$

While the problem does not specify the required material, suspensions
obviously will undergo repeated and impact loadings---especially since
this is a mountain bike. A proper choice in this case would be
Chrome-Vanadium or Chrome-Silicon, as it provides good fatigue and shock
resistance. In this problem, we will go with Chrome-Vanadium (\(A\) =
2005, \(m\) = 0.168).

Next, consider the stress limitation to select \(D\) and \(d\). By setting
\(N_s\) = 1.25 and \(\xi\) = 0.15, if we choose \(d\) = 2.5 mm for the front
suspension, the spring index \(C\) can be calculated.

$$\begin{aligned}
    \alpha  &= \frac{\tau _{allow}}{N_s} = \frac{0.45}{1.25}\frac{2005}{2.5^{0.168}} \times 10^6 = 619 \text{ MPa} \\ 
    \beta  &= \frac{8(1 + \xi )F_{\max}}{\pi d^2} = \frac{8(1 + 0.15)167}{\pi (2.5 \times 10^{-3})^2} = 78.2 \text{ MPa}
  \end{aligned}$$ $$\begin{aligned}
    C &= \frac{2\alpha  - \beta}{4\beta} + \sqrt {\left( \frac{2\alpha  - \beta}{4\beta} \right)^2 - \frac{3\alpha}{4\beta}}  \\ 
      & = \frac{2(619) - 78.2}{4(78.2)} + \sqrt {\left( \frac{2(619) - 78.2}{4(78.2)} \right)^2 - \frac{3(619)}{4(78.2)}}  \\ 
      &= 6.5 
  \end{aligned}$$

Repeating the same procedure for the seat spring, setting the same
safety measures and choosing \(d\) = 5 mm.

$$\begin{aligned}
    \alpha &= \frac{\tau_{allow}}{N_s} = \frac{0.45}{1.25}\frac{2005}{5^{0.168}} \times 10^6 = 550\text{ MPa} \\ 
    \beta &= \frac{8(1 + \xi )F_{\max}}{\pi d^2} = \frac{8(1 + 0.15)700}{\pi (5 \times 10^{-3})^2} = 82\text{ MPa}
  \end{aligned}$$ $$\begin{aligned}
    C &= \frac{2\alpha  - \beta}{4\beta} + \sqrt {\left( \frac{2\alpha  - \beta}{4\beta} \right)^2 - \frac{3\alpha}{4\beta}}  \\ 
      &= \frac{2(550) - 82}{4(82)} + \sqrt {\left( \frac{2(550) - 82}{4(82)} \right)^2 - \frac{3(550)}{4(82)}}  \\ 
      &= 5.24
  \end{aligned}$$

Apply the stiffness requirement to determine the required number of
active coils.

$$\begin{aligned}
    N_{af} &= \frac{Gd}{8C^3k} = \frac{77.2 \times 10^9(2.5 \times 10^{-3})}{8(6.5^3)(23400)} = 3.75 \\
    N_{as} &= \frac{Gd}{8C^3k} = \frac{77.2 \times 10^9(5 \times 10^{-3})}{8(5.24^3)(70000)} = 4.79
  \end{aligned}$$

To determine the pitches, and thus the spring lengths, we will assume
that the spring ends are squared and ground so that both are parallel.
The maximum deflections of the front and seat springs are

$$\begin{aligned}
    \delta_f &= \frac{F_f}{k_f} = \frac{167}{23400} = 7.14 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} \\
    \delta_s &= \frac{F_s}{k_s} = \frac{700}{70000} = 1 \times 10^{-2}\text{ m}
  \end{aligned}$$

As a general rule of thumb the maximum deflection should not exceed 80\%
of the spring compression range, which is \(N_a(p - d)\), the designed
pitches for the front and seat springs are

$$\frac{\delta}{N_a(p - d)} = 0.8$$

For the front suspension spring pitch,

$$\begin{aligned}
    p_f &= \frac{\delta _f}{0.8N_{af}} + d_f \\ 
          &= \frac{7.14 \times 10^{-3}}{0.8(6.5)} + 2.5 \times 10^{-3} \\ 
          &= 3.87 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}
  \end{aligned}$$

And similarly, for the seat spring pitch,

$$\begin{aligned}
    p_s &= \frac{\delta _s}{0.8N_{as}} + d_s \\ 
          &= \frac{1 \times 10^{-2}}{0.8(5.24)} + 5 \times 10^{-3} \\ 
          &= 7.39 \times 10^{-3}\text{ m}
  \end{aligned}$$

An 1200-kg empty car with the following dimensions stands 15 cm from the
ground both in the front and the rear. However, when it is fully loaded
by adding 150 kg to the front seats and 200 kg to the back seats, the
front and the rear stand 13 cm and 12 cm from the ground, respectively.
Design the front and rear springs for the suspension system of this car.

First, we need to find the maximum load in the front and rear
suspension. Use static equilibrium. For the empty car

$$\begin{aligned}
     2F_{r1}(2595) &= 12000(1050) \\
     F_{r1} &= 2428 \text{ N} \\
     2F_{f1} &= 12000 - 2(4856) = 7144 \\
     F_{f1} &= 3572 \text{ N}
   \end{aligned}$$

For the fully loaded car, the added front load goes at the c.g., while
the read load goes in the middle of c.g. and rear wheel. The distance
from the rear load to the rear wheel is

$$\begin{gathered}
     d_r = \frac{2595 - 1050}{2} = 772.5 \text{ mm}
   \end{gathered}$$

The front and rear loads in the fully loaded car are

$$\begin{aligned}
     2F_{f2}(2595) &= (12000 + 1500)(2595 - 1050) + 2000(772.5) \\
     F_{f2} &= 4316 \text{ N} \\
     2F_{r2} &= 12000 + 1500 + 2000 - 2(4316) \\
     F_{r2} &= 3434 \text{ N}
   \end{aligned}$$

With known loads, we can determine the spring \(C\) from stress equation.
First, the front springs. By setting \(N_s\) = 1.25 and \(\xi\) = 0.15, if
we choose \(d\) = 15 mm for the front suspension, the spring index \(C\) can
be calculated.

$$\begin{aligned}
    \alpha &= \frac{\tau_{allow}}{N_s} = \frac{0.5}{1.25}\frac{2005}{15^{0.168}} \times 10^6 = 509 \text{ MPa} \\ 
    \beta &= \frac{8(1 + \xi)F_{\max}}{\pi d^2} = \frac{8(1 + 0.15)4316}{\pi (15 \times 10^{-3})^2} = 56.2 \text{ MPa}
  \end{aligned}$$ $$\begin{aligned}
    C &= \frac{2\alpha  - \beta}{4\beta} + \sqrt {\left( \frac{2\alpha  - \beta}{4\beta} \right)^2 - \frac{3\alpha}{4\beta}}  \\ 
      & = \frac{2(509) - 56.2}{4(56.2)} + \sqrt {\left( \frac{2(509) - 56.2}{4(56.2)} \right)^2 - \frac{3(509)}{4(56.2)}}  \\ 
      &= 7.7 
  \end{aligned}$$

We perform the same calculation for the rear springs. Pick \(d\) = 13 mm
since the maximum force is slightly smaller than the front springs.

$$\begin{aligned}
     \alpha &= \frac{\tau_{allow}}{N_s} = \frac{0.5}{1.25}\frac{2005}{13^{0.168}} \times 10^6 = 521 \text{ MPa} \\ 
    \beta &= \frac{8(1 + \xi)F_{\max}}{\pi d^2} = \frac{8(1 + 0.15)3434}{\pi (13 \times 10^{-3})^2} = 59.5 \text{ MPa}
  \end{aligned}$$ $$\begin{aligned}
    C &= \frac{2\alpha  - \beta}{4\beta} + \sqrt {\left( \frac{2\alpha  - \beta}{4\beta} \right)^2 - \frac{3\alpha}{4\beta}}  \\ 
      & = \frac{2(521) - 59.5}{4(59.5)} + \sqrt {\left( \frac{2(521) - 59.5}{4(59.5)} \right)^2 - \frac{3(521)}{4(59.5)}}  \\ 
      &= 7.4 
  \end{aligned}$$

\(D\) of the front and rear springs can be easily calculated

$$\begin{aligned}
    D_f &= Cd = 7.7(15) = 116 \text{ mm} \\
    D_r &= 7.4(13) = 96.2 \text{ mm}
  \end{aligned}$$

Spring constants is needed to determine the required number of active
coils \(N_a\). $$\begin{aligned}
    k_f &= \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} = \frac{4316 - 3572}{0.02} \\
        &= 37200 \text{ N/m} \\
    k_r &= \frac{3434 - 2428}{0.03} \\
        &= 33533 \text{ N/m}
  \end{aligned}$$

Determine the \(N_a\)

$$\begin{aligned}
    N_{af} &= \frac{Gd}{8C^3k} = \frac{77.2 \times 10^9(15 \times 10^{-3})}{8(7.7^3)(37200)} = 8.6 \\
    N_{ar} &= \frac{Gd}{8C^3k} = \frac{77.2 \times 10^9(13 \times 10^{-3})}{8(7.4^3)(33533)} = 9.3 \\
  \end{aligned}$$

Determine pitch \(p\), as a rule of thumb, max deflection should not
exceed 80\% of the spring compression range, which is \(N_a(p - d)\). The
max deflection of the front and rear springs are

$$\begin{aligned}
    \delta_f &= \frac{F_{f2}}{k_f} = \frac{4316}{37200} \\
             &= 1.16 \times 10^{-1} \text{ m} \\
    \delta_r &= \frac{F_{r2}}{k_r} = \frac{3434}{33533} \\
             &= 1.02 \times 10^{-1} \text{ m}
  \end{aligned}$$

Finally, the pitches of the front and rear springs are

$$\frac{\delta}{N_a(p - d)} = 0.8$$

$$\begin{aligned}
    p_f &= \frac{\delta_f}{0.8N_{af}} + d_f \\ 
          &= \frac{1.16 \times 10^{-1}}{0.8(8.6)} + 15 \times 10^{-3} \\ 
          &= 3.19 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m} \\
    p_r &= \frac{\delta_r}{0.8N_{ar}} + d_r \\ 
          &= \frac{1.02 \times 10^{-1}}{0.8(9.3)} + 13 \times 10^{-3} \\ 
          &= 2.67 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}
  \end{aligned}$$

\subsection{Design of Helical Compression Springs for Fatigue Loading}
\label{design-of-helical-compression-springs-for-fatigue-loading}
This section covers additional considerations for designing helical
compression spring for fatigue loading. Figure 6.6 shows a typical \(S-N\)
diagram of a steel wire under reversed torsional load. Under fatigue
loading, compression springs tend not to experience stress
reversals---loadings typically only vary between zero and some
compressive loads. Thus, when considering the constant--life fatigue
diagram, the region of interest is the lower right diagonal of Figure
6.7, which lies between \(\tau_a / \tau_m = 1\) and \(\tau_a / \tau_m = 0\)
in which the number represents the ratio of alternating shear stress to
mean shear stress. These values can be referred to when calculating
required wire and coil diameters to satisfy stress limitation.

In designing helical springs for fatigue loading, two manufacturing
methods proved effective in enhancing fatigue resistance: shot peening
and presetting. Both of these methods create residual stress in the
wire, allowing the spring to take more stress in the opposite direction.

\subsection{Frequency Consideration}
\label{frequency-consideration}
Spring used in high-speed machinery must have natural frequencies of
vibration well in excess of the frequency of motion they control. For
example, a conventional engine valve spring goes through one cycle of
shortening and elongating every two engine revolutions. The valve motion
is definitely not sinusoidal (single frequency), and a Fourier analysis
indicates that harmonics up to about the thirteenth can be of
significant magnitude. Thus, at 5000 engine rpm, the fundamental spring
motion has a frequency of 2500 (once every two revolutions), and the
thirteenth harmonic 32,500 rpm or 542 Hz.

When a helical spring is compressed and suddenly released, it vibrates
longitudinally at its natural frequency until the energy is dissipated
through damping. Similarly, if a helical spring is fixed at one end and
given sufficiently rapid compression at the other, the end coil is
pushed against the adjacent coil before the remaining coils have time to
shear the displacement. Then, if the free end is held fixed after the
rapid compression, the local excessive displacement will travel along
the spring until it reaches the opposite end where the disturbance is
reflected back and so on until the energy is dissipated. This phenomenon
is called \emph{spring surge} and causes local stresses approximating those
for spring solid. Spring surge also decreases the ability of the spring
to control the motion of the machine part involved. The natural
frequency of a spring is

$$\begin{gathered}
    f_n = \sqrt {\dfrac{k}{m}}
  \end{gathered}$$

where

$$\begin{gathered}
    k \propto \frac{Gd^4}{D^3N_a} \hfill \\
    m \propto d^2DN_a\rho  \hfill
\end{gathered}$$

So we have that

$$f_n \propto \sqrt {\frac{d^4G/(D^3N_a)}{d^2DN_a\rho }}  = \frac{d}{D^2N_a}\sqrt {\frac{G}{\rho }}$$

For steel springs, the natural frequency in Hertz is

$$f_n = \frac{3.53 \times 10^8d}{N_aD^2}$$

where \(d\) and \(D\) are in meters. As a safety precaution, the natural
frequency of the first mode of vibration of the designed spring should
be at least 15-20 times that of the system.

\subsection{Helical Extension Springs}
\label{helical-extension-springs}
Most of the equations for helical compression springs applies equally
well to extension springs, but we need to note a few difference between
them. First, extension springs do not have the automatic over load stop
feature of a compression springs---tensile springs cannot rely on their
solid load to stop tensile overload. Furthermore, a broken compression
spring may continue to provide a stop that holds the plates apart, while
a broken tensile spring does not provide any load to keep the involved
parts together. For these reasons, compression springs are generally
preferred to extension springs in safety-critical applications. On the
other hand, extension springs do not buckle.

Extension springs are usually wound while maintaining a torsional stress
in the wire. This results in the coils pressing against each other. The
initial tension is the external force applied to the spring when the
coils are just at the verge of separating. A typical initial tension
recommended by spring manufacturers is the force so that

$$\tau_{initial} = (0.4 \text{ to } 0.8)\frac{S_{ut}}{C}$$

An extension spring wound in this manner will not deflect until loaded
with a force exceeding the initial tension, after which the equations
for stress and spring constant developed for compression springs will
apply.

The critical stresses in an extension spring often occur in the end
hooks. There are typically two locations where the stresses are the
highest, as shown in
[[\#fig: stress in extension spring hooks]\ref{fig: stress in extension spring hooks}].
The bending stress in section A and torsional stress in section B can be
written as

\begin{figure}[h]

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Critical stress locations in extension spring end hooks.}
  \label{fig: stress in extension spring hooks}
\end{figure}

\begin{gather}
\label{eqn: critical stresses in end hook}
  \sigma_A = \frac{16FD}{\pi d^3}\left( \frac{r_1}{r_3} \right) \\ 
  \tau_B = \frac{8FD}{\pi d^3}\left( \frac{r_4}{r_2} \right)
\end{gather}

The actual critical point between sections A and B obviously depends on
the allowable normal and shear stresses of the spring material.
Generally, the maximum allowable normal stress is twice as much as its
shear counterpart. In that case, the deciding factor comes down to the
ratios \(r_1 / r_3\) and \(r_4 / r_2\). This problem of critical stresses
can be partially remedied by making the last few coils smaller than the
rest of the spring to reduce the bending and torsional moment arms.

Design of a Chest Exercise Equipment Spring


Chest exercise equipment is composed of two identical springs attached
to a spring plate at each end. The user simply pulls on the handles and
stretch the springs to exercise. A schematic drawing of the equipment is
show below. The maximum pulling force allowed is 700 N and the
unstretched spring is 1 m long. Using a safety factor of 2,

\begin{itemize}
\item Determine the proper spring to be used.
\end{itemize}

Note: Assume any other values or dimensions you think are necessary to
solve the problem.

The problem did not mention the maximum stretched length of the spring.
However, this is a chest exercise machine and its reasonable maximum
length should approximately be of a length of an average human reach,
say 1.5 m. We can calculate the required spring stiffness.

$$k = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} = \frac{350 - 0}{1.5 - 1} = 700\text{ N/m}$$

\begin{itemize}
\item Pick extension spring.

\item No requirements for shock load or corrosion resistance.

\item Pick the inexpensive \emph{hard-drawn} wire
\end{itemize}

Equations for required diameter is

$$\begin{gathered}
  \sigma_{\max} = \frac{16FD}{\pi d^3}\left( \frac{r_1}{r_3} \right) = \frac{16FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{r_1}{r_3} \right) \hfill \\
  \tau _{\max} = \frac{8FD}{\pi d^3}\left( \frac{r_4}{r_2} \right) = \frac{8FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{r_4}{r_2} \right) \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$


According to the picture, \(r_1 = D / 2\), \(r_3 = (D - d) / 2\). Let us
also assume that \(r_4 = D / 3\), which gives \(r_2 = D / 3 - d / 2\). For a
relatively low stiffness spring, we will assume that the spring index
\(C\) = 8, which allows us to solve for \(d\).

$$\begin{gathered}
  \sigma_{\max} = \frac{S_{ut}}{N_s} = \frac{16FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{r_1}{r_3} \right) = \frac{16FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{D}{D - d} \right) \\
  \frac{1}{2}\frac{A}{d^m} = \frac{16FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{C}{C - 1} \right) \\ 
  \frac{1}{2}\frac{1783 \times 10^6 \times 10^{-3(0.190)}}{d^{0.190}} = \frac{16(350)(8)(8)}{\pi d^2(8 - 1)} \\
  \begin{aligned}
  &d^{2 - 0.190} = 6.79 \times 10^{-5} \\ 
  &d = 4.98 \times 10^{-3}\text{ m} = 4.98\text{ mm}
  \end{aligned}\end{gathered}$$

$$\begin{gathered}
  \tau_{\max} = \frac{\tau_{allow}}{N_s} = \frac{8FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{r_4}{r_2} \right) = \frac{8FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{D/3}{D/3 - d/2} \right) \\ 
  \frac{0.5}{2}\frac{A}{d^m} = \frac{8FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{C/3}{C/3 - 1/2} \right) \\ 
  \frac{0.45}{2}\frac{1783 \times 10^6 \times 1^{-3(0.190)}}{d^{0.190}} = \frac{8(350)(8)(8/3)}{\pi d^2(8/3 - 1/2)} \\
  \begin{aligned}
  &d^{2 - 0.190} = 8.13 \times 10^{-5} \\ 
  &d = 5.50 \times 10^{-3}\text{ m} = 5.50 \text{ mm}
  \end{aligned}\end{gathered}$$

In this problem, the limiting factor is the shear stress (since it
requires the larger of the two diameters). Therefore, the wire diameter
\(d\) = 5.50 mm, which gives the coil diameter \(D = Cd\) = 4.4 cm. Finally,
the number of required active coils is

$$N_a = \frac{Gd}{8C^3k} = \frac{79.3 \times 10^9(5.5 \times 10^{-3})}{8(8^3)(700)} = 152\text{ coils}$$

\section{Beam Springs}
\label{beam-springs}
Beams springs (commonly fabricated as multileaf springs) are usually
arranged as cantilevers and simply supported beams in the form of a
quarter, half, or full ellipse as shown in
[[\#fig: leaf springs]\ref{fig: leaf springs}]. These are also called flat
springs, though they typically have some curvature when unloaded. Note
that in each case, the basic element is a cantilever of length \(L\)
loaded by force \(F\). The common semielliptic spring can be thought of as
two cantilevers sharing the load in parallel. The full-elliptic spring
has four cantilevers, arranged in a series-parallel arrangement. It is
only necessary to analyze the stress and deflection characteristics of
the simple cantilever spring, for the same equations can readily be
adapted to cover the other two types.

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{A semi-elliptical leaf spring.}
  \label{fig: leaf springs}
\end{figure}

When designing a leaf spring, it is desirable for the spring to have
constant stress throughout its length. This is in fact very similar to
the concept of fully stressed beams in which the top and bottom surfaces
of the beam is designed to have constant maximum allowable stress. If a
cantilever has a \(b \times h\) cross section at the fixed end and load
\(F\) applied at the free end. The bending stress at the fixed end is

$$\sigma  = \frac{My}{I} = \frac{6FL}{bh^2}$$

The dimension of the cross section away from the fixed end can be set so
that the stress has this same value, such that

$$\begin{gathered}
    \sigma  = \frac{6FL}{bh^2} = \frac{6Fx}{wt^2} \\
    \frac{wt^2}{x} = \frac{bh^2}{L} \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

where \(w\) and \(t\) are the width and thickness of the beam and \(x\) is the
distance from the free end. If the thickness is held constant, the
constant-stress leaf spring will have a triangular profile width, and if
the width is held constant, the spring will have a parabolic profile
thickness.

The differences between one single constant-stress leaf spring and a
series of leaves with equal width and variable length arranged in the
form of a leaf spring are 1) interleaf friction provides damping in the
multileaf spring and 2) the multileaf spring can carry a full load in
only one direction since the leaves tend to separate when loaded in the
opposite direction, though this can be partially overcome by clipping
the leaves together.

Because of varying cross section, the derivation of the deflection
equation for the idealized triangular leaf spring is rather complicated
using direct integration. The problem, however, becomes much simpler
with the application off Castigliano's theorem.

Stiffness of a beam spring

Determine the deflection and spring constant of a cantilever beam spring
with constant-stress whose cross-sectional area at the fixed end is
\(b \times h\) and has a downward force \(F\) applied at the free end.


Castigliano's theorem states that

$$\delta_i = \frac{\partial U}{\partial F_i}$$

where \(U\) is the strain energy of the system and \(F\) is the force
applied at the point of interest. This can be rewritten in terms of
bending moment \(M\), young's modulus \(E\), and moment of inertia of the
cross section \(I\) as

$$\begin{aligned}
    \delta  &= \frac{\partial }{\partial F} \int_0^L \frac{M^2}{2EI}dx \\ 
            &= \int_0^L \left( \frac{M}{EI} \right)\left( \frac{\partial M}{\partial F} \right)dx \\ 
            &= \int_0^L \frac{Fx}{\dfrac{Ebxh^3}{12L}}xdx \\ 
            &= \left. \frac{12Fx^2L}{2Ebh^3} \right|_0^L \\ 
            &= \frac{6FL^3}{Ebh^3}
  \end{aligned}$$

The corresponding spring constant is

$$k = \frac{F}{\delta } = \frac{Ebh^3}{6L^3}$$

It is important to observe these differences when designing leaf
springs.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The spring end cannot be brought to a sharp joint but must be wide
enough to provide attachment with the loading member and to carry the
transverse shear load.

\item The derivation of the deflection equations assumed that deflections
were too small to influence the geometry. For deflections exceeding
30\% of the cantilever length, a more precise analysis is needed.

\item Unlike helical springs, beam springs are able to carry structural
loads as well as spring loads. For example, leaf springs in
automobile suspension systems are able to withstand lateral load when
turning and forward and backward loads during acceleration and
braking. These loads, of course, must be considered when designing
the spring.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Torsion Springs}
\label{torsion-springs}
There are two general types of torsion springs: helical and spiral
([[\#fig: spiral and helical springs]\ref{fig: spiral and helical springs}]).
The primary stress in all torsion springs is bending, since the load is
usually applied perpendicular to the wire and causing it to bend.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw [line width=5pt, SkyBlue, domain=0:25.1327,variable=\t,smooth,samples=75] plot ({\t r}: {0.002*\t*\t});

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Spiral and helical torsion springs.}
  \label{fig: spiral and helical springs}
\end{figure}

The analysis of stresses in curved beams is applicable. The highest
stress in on the inside of the wire and is equal to

$$\sigma_i = \frac{K_iMc}{I}$$

where \(K_i\) is given in [[\#fig: torsion spring stress conc]\ref{fig: torsion spring stress conc}] for various cross sections used in spring application.

  \caption{Curvature--stress concentration factor for torsion springs, round and rectangular wires.}
  \label{fig: torsion spring stress conc}
\end{figure}

For round wire, we have

$$\begin{gathered}
    \frac{I}{c} = \frac{\pi d^3}{32} \hfill \\
    \sigma_i = \frac{32MK_{i,round}}{\pi d^3} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

and for rectangular wire

$$\begin{gathered}
    \frac{I}{c} = \frac{bh^2}{6} \hfill \\
    \sigma_i = \frac{6MK_{i,rect}}{bh^2} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

For fatigue applications, special care must be taking in the design of
the end portion of the wire and its engagement with the loading member,
as points of stress concentration at the ends are frequent sites of
fatigue failure. Spiral springs are usually made of thin rectangular
wire. Square or rectangular wire is also most efficient for use in
helical torsion springs, but round wire is often used in noncritical
applications because it is more available and usually costs less.

\section{Summary}
\label{summary-5}
Springs are used to control loads and deformations, to store and absorb
energy from impacts and movements, and to exert loads on specific
components. In this chapter we discussed mainly the design procedures
for helical compression and tension springs under static and fatigue
loads. Significant conditions to consider are the allowable
loads/stresses, spring constant, and require length. As the governing
equations and number of parameters involved can be extensive and may
require multiple recalculations, it is suggested that students use a
programming calculator or spreadsheet to lighten the manual calculation
workload.

\chapter{Welded Joint Design}
\label{welded-joint-design}
Welding is an addition process whereby two or more components are
permanently joined by first partially melting the common surfaces. Once
the surfaces cool, the common surface will become more or less
homogenous with both materials, thus joining them. It has advantages
over other types of joint in that it is typically less expensive and
less complicated. It also does not introduce foreign substances to the
joint area, nor does it introduce holes and cuts which can lead to
stress concentration.

\section{Types of Welding}
\label{types-of-welding}
Modern industrial welding is done by fusion, with the workpieces melting
at their common surfaces. Heat is applied by an electric arc passing
between an electrode and the work, by high-amperage electric current
passing through the mating workpieces, or by gas flame. Welding takes
several forms, typically based on the source of heat, as follows.

\subsection{Electric arc welding}
\label{electric-arc-welding}
In this process, workpieces is heated by an electric arc passing from an
electrode to the pieces. Electric arc welding is further categorized
depending on how the filler material is applied and the way the molten
metal is shielded from the atmosphere.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW)
\label{shielded-metal-arc-welding-smaw}
Also called stick welding, it is the common manual process used for
repair work and the welding of large structures. The welder feeds a
consumable, coated electrode (welding rod) in the work area. A flux
coating on the electrode releases a shielding gas and forms slag around
the weld metal. SMAW is typically used with steels.


\url{pictures/Welding/shield-metal-arc-welding}

\item Gas metal arc welding (GMAW)
\label{gas-metal-arc-welding-gmaw}
Also called metal-inert gas (MIG) welding, it is a commonly automated
process producing high-quality welds at high welding speeds with most
metals. The consumable electrode is not coated, but it projects from a
nozzle that supplies a shielding gas---argon for aluminum and other
non-ferrous metals, low-cost carbon dioxide for steels.

\item Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW)
\label{gas-tungsten-arc-welding-gtaw}
Also called tungsten-inert gas (TIG) welding, it employs a nonconsumable
tungsten electrode, with a filler wire sometimes fed in separately. A
nozzle surrounding the tungsten electrode supplies helium or argon gas
for shielding. This process is slower than GMAW but can be used with
thinner metals, either ferrous or nonferrous. The process gives
high-quality welds of nonferrous and dissimilar metals and can be fully
automated.

\url{pictures/Welding/gas-tungsten-arc-welding}

\item Flux-cored arc welding (FCAW)
\label{flux-cored-arc-welding-fcaw}
It is much like SMAW, except that the flux is in the hollow core of the
consumable electrode rather than on its outer surface. A shielding gas
(usually carbon dioxide) is sometimes supplied from a nozzle surrounding
the electrode. The process produces fast, clean welds on ferrous metals.

\item Submerged arc welding (SAW)
\label{submerged-arc-welding-saw}
It is done on flat workpieces. A mound or line of granular flux is
deposited on the workpieces in advance of the moving consumable
electrode. The flux melts to produce a protective molten slag, under
which the fresh weld is "submerged." The process is commonly used with
thick sections requiring deep weld penetration.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Resistance Welding}
\label{resistance-welding}
In this process, electric current generates heat by the process of
Joules heating (\(I^2R\)). The current passes through the workpieces while
they are clamped firmly together. No flux or shielding is used, but the
process may be carried out in a vacuum or inert gas. Filler material is
not typically used. Resistance welding is especially suited for mass
production of continuous welds (such as pipe seams) or spot welds of
most steels and aluminum alloys. Material thicknesses range from
approximately 0.01 -- 2 cm.

\subsection{Gas welding}
\label{gas-welding}
The process is usually performed manually with an oxyacetylene torch and
is typically slow. It requires more generalized heating of the work, and
is most often used for making repairs. A filler wire is usually, but not
necessarily, used.

Other kinds of welding processes such as Laser beam, plasma arc,
electron beam, and electroslag are also fusion welding and are used on a
small scale for very special applications. Nonfusion, or solid-state
welding, processes use a combination of heat and pressure to join parts,
though the temperature is usually less than the melting point of the
materials.

\section{Welding Material}
\label{welding-material}
The basic concept of fusion welding is to fuse the materials together
into a single and homogenous member. Properties of the welding rod
(filler) must be properly matched with those of the parent materials.

Welding electrode material strength and ductility specifications have
been standardized by the American Welding Society (AWS). The properties
are listed in
[[\#table: electrode properties]\ref{table: electrode properties}].

\section{Welded Joint Geometry}
\label{welded-joint-geometry}
Weld geometry depends on the orientation of mating parts. It is one of
the two ingredients, along with load direction, in determining the type
of stresses exerted on the weld and determining proper weld lengths and
effective thicknesses.

\subsection{Butt Welds}
\label{butt-welds}
In this type of welded joints, the mating parts are joined by having
their ends attached together without any overlap. Typically the ends
have the same thickness and length, and after welding, the part
essentially become one continuous part. The cross section of the weld is
considered to be \(H \times L\), even though for most butt welds there are
always slight reinforcement so that the thicknesses are slightly larger
than \(H\).


If the welds are of good quality, they can be considered as strong as
the plate, and its efficiency (welded member strength / solid member
strength) is 100\%.

\subsection{Fillet Welds}
\label{fillet-welds}
In this type of welded joint, the weld is formed not on the flat end
surface but instead on the angle (typically 90 degree) formed between
the mating parts. This type of welds are commonly classified according
to the direction of loading: parallel welds or transverse welds.


\section{Welded Joints under Static Axial and Shear Loading}
\label{section: stress in weld under axial and shear}
Ideally, if the welding electrode is properly chosen so that it matches
the properties of the parent materials, the stress and strength analysis
would proceed as though the part were made from a single piece of stock.

The stresses in welds depend both on its geometry and loading direction.
In butt welds, the stress in the welds is the same as the stress in the
material. Under a normal force \(F_n\), the weld is under a normal stress.


$$\sigma  = \frac{F_n}{A_w} = \frac{F_n}{HL}$$

where \(H\) is the throat length and \(L\) is the weld length. Similarly,
under a shear force \(F_s\), the weld is under a shear stress.

$$\tau  = \frac{F_s}{A_w} = \frac{F_s}{HL}$$

In fillet welds, under parallel loading, both plates exert a shear load
on the weld. With transverse loading, one plate exerts a shear load and
the other a normal (tensile or compressive) load on the weld. The
cross-sectional area size of the weld is defined by the \emph{weld length}
and the shortest distance from the intersection of the plates to the
straight line connecting the ends of the two legs, also called \emph{throat
length} or \emph{effective throat thickness}.


The corresponding shear stresses for fillet welds under axial or shear
loading is, therefore,

$$\begin{gathered}
    \tau = \frac{F_s}{HL} \\
    \tau = \frac{F_n}{HL}
  \end{gathered}$$

Throat length \(H\) should be reasonably proportioned in comparison to the
thickness of plates being welded. For practical reasons, \(H\) is usually
a minimum of 3 mm for plate less than 6 mm thick, and up to a minimum of
15 mm for plates over 150 mm thick. It is also important to note that
fillet welds are typically done in pairs to maintain symmetry and avoid
any resultant moments, in which case the effective weld area doubles.

\section{Welded Joints under Static Torsional and Bending Loading}
\label{welded-joints-under-static-torsional-and-bending-loading}
External loading can cause torsional or bending to welded joints when
the loads do not pass through the centroid of the welds---also called
eccentric loading. If the load is in the plane of the weld group, the
welded connection will be subjected to torsion, and if the load is out
of plane of the weld group, it will cause bending. Note that there
usually are direct loading to the welds caused by these loads as
considered in the previous section.

Though a rigorous analysis of each weld segment under torsion or bending
is possible, it would be very complicated, involving material properties
and geometry of the base materials and the welds. On the other hand,
sufficiently accurate results can be obtained by applying the following
simplifications.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Direct shear and normal stresses can be assumed uniformly distributed
over the length of all welds and calculated as in
\hyperref[section: stress in weld under axial and shear]{1.4}.

\item The parts being jointed can be assumed rigid and the torsional and
bending stresses can be calculated using the conventional formulas.

$$\begin{gathered}
       \tau  = \frac{Tr}{J} \hfill \\
       \sigma  = \frac{My}{I} \hfill \\ 
     \end{gathered}$$
\end{enumerate}

Since the cross section on which the stresses are calculated is the weld
group, the corresponding moment of inertia (\(I\)) and polar moment of
inertia (\(J\)) must be calculated from the weld cross section. In order
to determine such moments, we must first locate the centroid of the weld
group. The expression for the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates of the centroid,
\(x_c\) and \(y_c\) is

$$\begin{aligned}
  x_c = \int_A xdA = \sum x_{ci}A_i \\
  y_c = \int_A ydA = \sum y_{ci}A_i\end{aligned}$$

where \(x_{ci}\) and \(y_{ci}\) are the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates of the
centroid of region \(i\) and \(A_i\) is the area of region \(i\). Essentially,
they are area-weighted average \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates.

Given that the centroid of the weld group is at (0,0), and that the weld
cross section has throat length \(H\) and weld length \(L\), and its
centroid is located at (\(a, b\)), we would have the following moments of
inertia



\begin{enumerate}
\item Moments of inertia of a linear weld segment about axes of symmetry
through the centroid

$$\begin{gathered}
           I_{xc} = \int y^2dA  = 2\int_0^{L/2} y^2Hdy  = \frac{L^3H}{12} \hfill \\
           {I_{yc}} = \frac{H^3L}{12} \hfill \\ 
         \end{gathered}$$

\item Moments of inertia about axes of symmetry through the centroid of the
total weld group is equal to the centroidal moments of inertia plus a
modification term from the parallel axis theorem.

\begin{gathered} 
  I_x = I_{xc} + Ab^2 = \frac{L^3H}{12} + LHb^2 \hfill \\
  I_y = I_{yc} + Aa^2 = \frac{LH^3}{12} + LHa^2 \hfill 
\label{eqn: weld group moment of inertia}
\end{gathered}

\item Polar moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the centroid
of the weld group.

$$J = I_x + I_y = \frac{1}{12}(L^3H + LH^3) + LH(a^2 + b^2)$$
\end{enumerate}

Dual fillet weld on a cantilever beam

Determine the maximum load \(P\) that can be applied to the structure as
shown below, given that the safety factor of the weld is 3. The weld has
the effective throat thickness of 3 mm, and is made with E70XX series
electrode.


In this loading configuration, the weld is subjected to shear force and
bending moment. The shear force causes shear stress, while the bending
moment causes normal stress. First, let us calculate the shear stress,
which is

$$\tau  = \frac{P}{2HL} = \frac{P}{2(0.003)(0.4)} = 417P$$

Notice the cross sectional area is multiplied by two for the top and
bottom welds. The normal bending stress is

$$\sigma  = \frac{My}{I} = \frac{P(1)(0.06)}{I} = 0.06\frac{P}{I}$$

The welds' moment of inertia is given by
[[\#eqn: weld group moment of inertia]\ref{eqn: weld group moment of inertia}].

$$\begin{gathered}
      I_y = 2\left( \frac{LH^3}{12} + LHa^2 \right) \\ 
      = 2\left( \frac{(0.4)(0.003)^3}{12} + (0.4)(0.003)(0.06)^2 \right) \\ 
      = 8.64 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^4 \\ 
    \end{gathered}$$

So the bending stress is

$$\sigma  = 0.06\frac{P}{8.64 \times 10^{-6}} = 6944P$$

Since welds can be considered brittle, the maximum normal stress theory
will be used to determine failure. The principal stress on the weld is

$$\begin{gathered}
      \sigma _1 = \frac{6944P}{2} + \sqrt {\left( \frac{6944P}{2} \right)^2 + (417P)^2}  \\ 
      = 6969P \\ 
    \end{gathered}$$

Finally, we substitute the electrode strength into the safety factor
equation to solve for \(P\).

$$\begin{gathered}
      N_s = \frac{\text{strength}}{\text{stress}} \\ 
      3 = \frac{482 \times 10^6}{6969P} \\ 
      P = 23000 \text{ N} \\ 
    \end{gathered}$$

Note that this is the allowable force considering the weld strength
only. The actual allowable force may be less than this, depending on the
strength of the beam itself.

Determine the critical point in the welds and its state of stress. The
weld throat thickness is 8 mm.


Because of the downward load at the end of the beam, the fillet welds
are under a combination of shear loading and torsion. In fact, we can
(and should) split the problem to analyze the resultant stress from each
load and combine those to obtain the final state of stress.

Let us first tackle the easier of the two problems: shear loading. This
is a simple case of a transverse fillet weld (where the shear load is
perperndicular to the weld length). The resultant shear stress from
shear loading, pointing in the same direction, is

$$\begin{aligned}
    \tau_{shear} &= \frac{P}{2HL} = \frac{20000}{2(0.008)(0.05)} \\
                 &= 25 \text{ MPa}
  \end{aligned}$$

Now consider the problem of torsion. The applied torque to the weld is
the load multiplied with the distance to the center of the welds \(L_o\).
In this problem the welds are symmetric, thereforce the center is in the
middle of the two welds, marked by \ldots{}

The shear stress from torsion can be written as

$$\begin{aligned}
    \tau_{torsion} &= \frac{Tr}{J_{group}} = \frac{P L_o r_o}{J_{group}} \\
                   &= \frac{20000(0.12-0.05/2) r_o}{J_{group}}
  \end{aligned}$$

the radius \(r_o\) represents the distance away from the center of the
weld. With this expression, we know that the shear stress in torsion is
the highest at the farthest four corners of the welds, at which points
\(r_o\) is

$$\begin{aligned}
    r_o = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{L}{2} \right)^2 + d_o^2 }
  \end{aligned}$$

where \(L\) is the weld length and \(d_o\) is the distance from the weld to
the center of weld. In this problem \(L\) = 5 cm and \(d_o\) = 4 cm/2 = 2
cm. Therefore,

$$\begin{aligned}
     r_o &= \sqrt{ \left( \frac{0.05}{2} \right)^2 + 0.02^2 } \\
         &= 0.032 \text{ m}
   \end{aligned}$$

We will also need to calculate the group polar moment of inertia
\(J_{group}\). It is obvious that neither weld cross sections coincides
with the center of weld, so we will need to apply the parallel axis
theorem so that

$$\begin{aligned}
     J_{group} &= J_c + A d_o^2 \\
               &= 2 \left[ \frac{HL^3}{12} +\frac{LH^3}{12} + LHd_o^2 \right] \\
               &= 2 \left[ \frac{(0.008)(0.05)^3}{12} + \frac{(0.05)(0.008)^3}{12} + (0.05)(0.008)(0.02)^2 \right] \\
               &= 1.70 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^4
   \end{aligned}$$

Now we have all the parameters we need, so we can substitute them back
into the torsional shear stress equation, which gives

$$\begin{aligned}
     \tau_{torsion} &= \frac{20000(0.12-0.05/2) r_o}{J_{group}} \\
                    &= \frac{20000(0.095)(0.032)}{1.7 \times 10^{-5}} \\
                    &= 3.58 \text{ MPa}
   \end{aligned}$$

All four corners have the same magnitude of torsional shear stresses,
but their directions differ. The direction of the torsional shear stress
is always perpendicular to the vector \(r_o\). Therefore, the corner with
the maximum combined shear stress (shear + torsional) is corner B and D.


We will consider the state of stress at point B from this point on. The
two stresses can then simply be added vectorially, either by breaking
them down into \(x\) and \(y\) components or by using vector addition
formula. We will use the latter in this problem.

$$\begin{aligned}
    \left| \vec{\tau}_{torsion} + \vec{\tau}_{shear} \right|^2 &= \left| \vec{\tau}_{torsion} \right|^2 + \left| \vec{\tau}_{shear} \right|^2 + 2 \vec{\tau}_{torsion} \cdot \vec{\tau}_{shear} \\
                                                               &= \left| \vec{\tau}_{torsion} \right|^2 + \left| \vec{\tau}_{shear} \right|^2 + 2 \left| \vec{\tau}_{torsion} \right| \left| \vec{\tau}_{shear} \right| \cos \alpha
  \end{aligned}$$

The last piece of the puzzle is to determine the angle \(\alpha\) between
the two shear stresses. We know that \(\tau_{shear}\) is directly downward
while \(\tau_{torsion}\) is perpendicular to vector OB. Thus,

$$\begin{aligned}
    \tan \alpha &= \frac{d_o}{L/2} = \frac{2 d_o}{L} \\
                &= \frac{2(0.02)}{0.05} = 0.8 \\
    \alpha &= \tan^{-1} 0.8 = 38.7^{\circ}
  \end{aligned}$$

Substitute \(\alpha\) into the vector addition formula to obtain the
combined shear stress

$$\begin{aligned}
    \left| \vec{\tau}_{torsion} + \vec{\tau}_{shear} \right|^2 &= 25^2 + 3.58^2 + 2(25)(3.58) \cos 38.7^{\circ} \\
                                                               &= 778 \\
    \left| \vec{\tau}_{torsion} + \vec{\tau}_{shear} \right| &= \left| \vec{\tau}_{total} \right| = 27.9 \text{ MPa}                                                        
  \end{aligned}$$

\section{Asymmetric Welded Joints}
\label{asymmetric-welded-joints}
There may arise situations where weld joints need not, or cannot, be
symmetrical. This is mostly due to the geometry of the joining parts. In
such cases, the same methodology applied to design of symmetrical joints
is still applicable, but we must be cautious and do not assume any
symmetry in the direction or magnitude of a stress or load. Since the
welds are not symmetric, the center of weld will likely not be in the
"middle." As such, critical point analysis must be done more carefully.

The weld dimensions and load are given in the figure.

\url{pictures/Welding/weld-under-torsion-and-bending}

If the weld throat thickness is 5 mm using E60 series, Determine this
weld safety factor.

The problem is similar to the previous torsion problem. The only
difference being the weld is asymmetric. Center of weld (\(G\)) must be
determined mathematically, and that is our first task.

Using the equation for center of weld and setting the origin (0,0) at
\(B\), we have

$$\begin{aligned}
    x_G &= \frac{(0.15H)(0) + (0.1H)(0.05)}{ 0.15H + 0.1H } \\
        &= 0.02 \text{ m} \\
    y_G &= \frac{(0.15H)(-0.075) + (0.1H)(0)}{ 0.15H + 0.1H } \\
        &= -0.045 \text{ m} 
  \end{aligned}$$

The problem can be split into a pure shear load problem and a pure
torsion problem. Let us first tackle the former.

The shear stress from shear load is simply

$$\begin{aligned}
    \tau_{shear} &= \frac{P}{H(L_1 + L_2)} \\
                 &= \frac{20000}{0.005(0.10 + 0.15)} \\
                 &= 16 \text{ MPa}
  \end{aligned}$$

Onto the pure torsion problem. Here, the formula for shear stress from
torsion still applies

$$\begin{aligned}
    \tau_{torsion} &= \frac{P L_o r_o}{J_{group}} \\
                   &= \frac{20000(0.3 - 0.02)r_o}{J_{group}} \\
  \end{aligned}$$

Unfortunately, the asymmetric weld complicates the problem in two ways.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Center of weld is not in the middle, the modification term in
parallel axis theorem for \(J_{group}\) must take the distance between
the center of weld and each weld's centroid.

\item Center of weld is not in the middle \(\rightarrow\) \(r_o\) is different
for each corner of the weld, making it difficult to locate the
critical point.
\end{enumerate}

Let us first calculate \(J_{group}\)

$$\begin{aligned}
    J_{group} &= J_c + A d_o^2 \\
              &= \frac{H(L_1^3 + L_2^3)}{12} +\frac{(L_1 + L_2)H^3}{12} + H(L_1d_{Gc1}^2 + L_2d_{Gc2}^2)
  \end{aligned}$$

where \(d_{Gc1}\) and \(d_{Gc2}\) are the distances from center of weld \(G\)
to the centroid of weld 1 and 2, respectively.

$$\begin{aligned}
    d_{Gc1}^2 &= (0.02-0)^2+(0.075-0.045)^2 \\
              &= 1.3 \times 10^{-3} \\
    d_{Gc2}^2 &= (0.05-0.02)^2 + (0.045 - 0)^2 \\
              &= 2.93 \times 10^{-3}
  \end{aligned}$$

Substitute the values to find \(J_{group}\) $$\begin{aligned}
    J_{group} &= \frac{(0.005)(0.1^3 + 0.15^3)}{12} +\frac{(0.1 + 0.15)(0.005)^3}{12} \\
              &+ (0.005)(0.1(1.3 \times 10^{-3}) + 0.15(2.93 \times 10^{-3})) \\
              &= 2.45 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^4
  \end{aligned}$$

Now, to address the critical point. We know that the direction of
\(\tau_{torsion}\) at each spot will be perpendicular to the vector \(r_G\)
connecting the center of weld to that point.

From the figure, it should be obvious that the resultant stress at A
should be the highest. We now proceed to calculate \(\tau_{torsionA}\).

$$\begin{aligned}
    \tau_{torsionA} &= \frac{P L_o r_{GA}}{J_{group}} \\
                    &=\frac{20000(0.28) r_{GA}}{2.45 \times 10^{-5}} \\[1em]
    r_{GA} &= \sqrt{(0.1 - 0.02)^2 + 0.045^2} \\
                    &= 0.092 \text{ m} \\[1em]
    \tau_{torsionA} &= 21 \text{ MPa}
  \end{aligned}$$

Combine \(\tau_{shear}\) and \(\tau_{torsion}\), we have $$\begin{aligned}

\section{Fatigue Considerations in Welded Joints}
\label{fatigue-considerations-in-welded-joints}
When welded joints are subjected to fatigue loading, small voids and
inclusions which have little effect on static strength can constitute
local stress concentration and reduce fatigue strength. In addition, the
weld material extending beyond the plane of the
plates---reinforcement---can cause stress concentration at the edges of
the weld bead. In fact, to increase fatigue strength, the weld bead
should be ground to flush with the plates. Approximate fatigue stress
concentration factors associated with butt weld reinforcement and other
weld geometries are given in
[[\#table: fatigue stress concentration factor]\ref{table: fatigue stress concentration factor}].

Fatigue analysis of a butt weld

A butt weld is subjected to a repeated axial load \(F\) ranging from 50000
to 100000 N as shown. The thickness of the material is 0.5 cm. The joint
is welded with E60 series electrode. Determine the proper weld length if
the required safety factor is 3.


\url{pictures/Welding/fatigue-weld-analysis-example}

Based on Soderberg relation, we have that

$$\frac{\sigma _a}{S_e} + \frac{\sigma _m}{S_y} = \frac{1}{N_s}$$

We can simply calculate the amplitude and average stresses.

$$\begin{gathered}
      \sigma_m = \frac{100000 + 50000}{2HL} = \frac{75000}{0.5 \times 10^{-2}L} = \frac{1.5 \times 10^7}{L} \hfill \\
      \sigma_a = \frac{100000 - 50000}{2HL} = \frac{25000}{0.5 \times 10^{-2}L} = \frac{5 \times 10^6}{L} \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}$$

However, due to stress concentration from reinforced butt weld, the
actual average stress and stress amplitudes are

$$\begin{gathered}
      \sigma_m = 1.2\left( \frac{1.5 \times 10^7}{L} \right) = \frac{1.8 \times 10^7}{L} \hfill \\
      \sigma_a = 1.2\left( \frac{5 \times 10^6}{L} \right) = \frac{6 \times 10^6}{L} \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}$$

The yield strength and endurance limit for E60 series are 345 MPa and
\(0.45 \times 427 = 192\) MPa, respectively. Substituting the values into
Soderberg relation, we have

$$\begin{gathered}
      \frac{\sigma_a}{S_e} + \frac{\sigma_m}{S_y} = \frac{1}{N_s} \hfill \\
      {1 \over L} \left( \frac{6 \times 10^6}{192 \times 10^6} + \frac{1.8 \times 10^7}{345 \times 10^6} \right) = \frac{1}{3} \hfill \\
      L = 2.5 \times {10^{-1}} = 25\text{ cm} \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}$$

\section{Summary}
\label{summary-6}
In this chapter, load and stress analyses of welds are given in details.
Strengths and weaknesses of different types of available welding
processes are discussed. Geometry of the joint is possibly the most
important in analyzing and properly designing weld joints. In fact, the
analyses of welded joints are similar to their solid member counter
parts, the only difference being taking into account changes in moments
of inertia. Additional factors involved static vs. fatigue loading. Two
key design parameters involved are the electrodes and the geometry of
the weld (length and effective throat thickness).

\chapter{Bolted Joint Design}
\label{bolted-joint-design}
At first look, threaded fasteners seem to be the most mundane of machine
elements. Upon further investigation, one can see that these seemingly
simple components exist in amazing variety and designs. Economically,
they contribute to substantial sum of any project especially structural
and large fabricating ones. The safety implications for these fasteners
used are obvious. Many fasteners must be designed for easy and low-cost
assembly while others must be designed for ease of disassembly. There
are also some that must be difficult to remove.

In this chapter, various guidelines and considerations involved in the
design and selection of proper threaded fasteners are discussed.
Applications of threaded fasteners in simple joints are also
illustrated.

\section{Thread forms, terminology, and standards}
\label{thread-forms-terminology-and-standards}
The basic arrangement of a helical thread wound around a cylinder are
illustrated in [[\#fig: bolt terms]\ref{fig: bolt terms}]. Pitch, lead, and
lead angle are defined by the illustrations. Virtually all bolts and
screws have a single thread, but power screws sometimes have double,
triple, or even quadruple threads.


\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{\label{fig: bolt terms}

\end{figure}

shows the standard geometry of screw threads used on fasteners. This is
essentially the same for both \emph{Unified} (inch series) and \emph{ISO} (metric)
threads. Standard sizes for the two systems given in
[[\#table: ISO Screw Dimensions]\ref{table: ISO Screw Dimensions}] show
both the \emph{fine thread} (UNF, Unified National Fine) and \emph{coarse thread}
(UNC, Unified National Coarse) series. The pitch diameter, \(d_p\), is the
diameter of a cylinder on a perfect thread where the width of the thread
and groove are equal. The \emph{stress area} tabulated is based on the
average of the pitch and root diameters. This is the area used for
stress (force/area) calculations. Note: Metric threads are identified by
diameter and pitch as M10 \(\times\) 1.5

Coarse-threaded bolts are more resistant to cross-threading and thread
stripping. They tend to be less susceptible to damage and require less
assembly time.

Fine-threaded bolts, on the other hand, are less prone to loosen under
vibration. The threads are easier to tap, especially on high-strength
materials. Also, because of their fine threads, allow for finer
adjustment and require less torque to obtain the same preload.

\section{Static Screw Stresses}
\label{static-screw-stresses}
When in use, screws are subjected to various stresses such as torsion
during tightening, axial load, and thread bearing stresses. Let us
consider each type of stress separately.

\subsection{Torsion}
\label{torsion-1}
Threaded fasteners are subjected to torsional stresses during
tightening, much like a cylindrical bar being twisted. The shear stress
caused by the exerted torque is
$$\tau  = \frac{Tc}{J} = \frac{16T}{\pi d_r^3}$$ where \(d_r\) is the
thread root diameter. With threaded fasteners, the equivalent of
substantial collar friction is normally present, in which case it is
customary to assume that the torque transmitted through the threaded
section is approximately half the wrench torque.

\subsection{Axial Load}
\label{axial-load}
The main purpose of threaded fasteners is to hold work pieces together
by exerting compressive forces on them. Therefore they are typically
subjected to tensile loads. The effective area for threaded fasteners is
the tensile area \(A_t\).

The distribution of the axial stress near the ends of the loaded portion
of a screw is not uniform. This is not a concern for static loading
because threaded fasteners should always have enough ductility to permit
local yielding at thread roots without damage. However, when we consider
fatigue loading of bolts, this stress concentration is very important.

\subsection{Combined Torsion and Axial Load}
\label{combined-torsion-and-axial-load}
The combination of the stresses can be treated with multiaxial stress
analysis which has been covered in \hyperref[section: multiaxial stress]{3.6}
using maximum distortion energy theory or maximum shear stress theory
since bolts and screws are considered ductile. With threaded fasteners,
it is normal for some yielding to occur at the thread roots during
initial tightening.

\subsection{Thread Bearing (Compressive) Stress}
\label{thread-bearing-compressive-stress}
illustrates the force flow through a bolt and a nut used to clamp two
members together. Compression between the screw and nut threads exists
on all threads. This type of direct compression is typically called
bearing, and the area used for stress calculation is the projected area
which for each thread is \(\pi(d_2 - d_i^2) / 4\). The number of threads
in contact is seen from the figure to be \(t/p\). Thus, the bearing stress
on each thread is


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Bolt/force-flow-bolt.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig: force flow in bolt}
Force flow in a bolt in tension \cite{juvinall2006fundamentals}}
\end{figure}

$$\sigma  = \frac{4P}{\pi (d^2 - d_r^2)}\frac{p}{t}$$

It is important to note that this equation only gives an average value
of the stress. In fact, the stress is not uniformly distributed among
the threads because of factors such as bending of the threads and
manufacturing variations. Furthermore, the threads all share the same
load, similar to members of a compound bar, the load will be distributed
most to the shortest (and stiffest) path. Hence, threads which are
closer to the clamped members will carry higher loads and stresses.

\subsection{Thread Shear (Stripping) Stress and Nut Thickness Requirement}
\label{thread-shear-stripping-stress-and-nut-thickness-requirement}
Nut or bolt threads can be stripped along its cylindrical surface under
sufficient overload. From the thread geometry shown in
[[\#fig: force flow in bolt]\ref{fig: force flow in bolt}] the shear area
is equal to \(\pi d(0.75t)\), where \(d\) is the diameter of the shear
fracture surface involved.

Now, assume that both the nut and bolt are made of the same material,
the nut thickness required to balance the bolt tensile strength and
thread stripping strength can be calculated. First the bolt tensile
force required to yield the threaded cross section is

$$F_{bolt} = A_tS_y \approx \frac{\pi}{4}(0.9d)^2S_y$$

where \(d\) is the major diameter of the thread. On the other hand, the
bolt tensile load required to yield the thread-stripping failure surface
of the nut based on a parabolic stress distribution is

$$F_{nut} = \pi d(0.75t)S_{sy} \approx \pi d(0.75t)(0.58S_y)$$

where \(t\) is the nut thickness. Equating \(F_{bolt}\) and \(F_{nut}\) to
balance the bolt and nut strengths gives


$$\label{eqn: required nut thickness}
  t = 0.47d$$

Since the nuts are usually softer than bolts in order to allow slight
yielding of the top threads and more uniform load distribution among the
threads, the standard nut thickness is approximately \(7d/8\).

\section{Thread Fastener Types}
\label{thread-fastener-types}
shows basic types of threaded fasteners. Screws and bolts are by far the
most common types, and the difference between them is only one of
intended use. Bolts are intended for use with nuts; screw are intended
for screwing into tapped holes.


A stud is threaded on both ends and is usually screwed permanently into
a tapped hole. Threads on the two ends may or may not be identical. A
threaded rod is the least common type. It is usually used when a very
long threaded member is desired. A threaded rod can often be purchased
in lengths of a few feet and then cut off as required.


\url{pictures/Bolt/head-types}


\url{pictures/Bolt/drive-types}

shows most of the common fastener head styles and drive types. As a
rule, a bolt can also serve as a screw by using it with a tapped hole.
Hexagonal-head screws and bolts are commonly used for connecting machine
components. Sometimes they cannot be used because of insufficient
clearance to put a socket or wrench on the head. In such cases the
hexagonal-socket head is often used.

\section{Fastener Materials and Methods of Manufacture}
\label{fastener-materials-and-methods-of-manufacture}
Materials for screws, nuts, and bolts are normally selected based on
strength, weight, corrosion resistance, magnetic properties, life
expectancy, and cost. Most fasteners are made from steel of
specifications standardized by the Society of Automotive Engineers and
summarized in
[[\#table: SAE grade properties]\ref{table: SAE grade properties}].

Heading is typically done cold for diameters up to 2 cm and heated for
larger sizes. Threads are usually formed by rolling between dies that
force the material to cold-form into the threaded contour of the die
grooves. Threads formed this way are stronger than cut or ground threads
in fatigue and impact loading because cold working can leave compressive
residual stresses at the thread roots (see . Because of these
advantages, high-strength screws and bolts should have rolled threads.
Furthermore, the greatest fatigue strength is obtained if the threads
are rolled after heat treatment so that the resulting work hardening and
favorable residual stresses are not lost.


\url{pictures/Bolt/thread-rolling}


\url{pictures/Bolt/thread-cutting}


\url{pictures/Bolt/cut-rolled-thread}

Fasteners are also made from aluminum, brass, copper, nickel, stainless
steel, titanium, and various plastics. Fastener materials must always be
considered in connection with any potential corrosion problems
associated with the environment and the other metals involved.
Additionally, appropriate coatings should be considered for corrosion
protection and to reduce thread friction and wear.

\section{Bolt Tightening and Initial Tension}
\label{bolt-tightening-and-initial-tension}
For most applications, screws and nut-bolt assemblies should ideally be
tightened to produce an initial tensile force \(F_i\) nearly equal to the
full "proof load," which is defined as the maximum tensile force that
does not produce a normally measurable permanent set. On this basis,
initial tensions are commonly specified in accordance with the equation

$$F_i = K_iA_tS_p$$

where At is the tensile stress area of the thread, Sp is the proof
strength of the material, and Ki is a constant, usually specified in the
range of 0.75 to 1.0. For ordinary applications involving static
loading, \(K_i \approx 0.9\) or

$$F_i = 0.9A_tS_p$$

illustrates bolt stress, both initially when tightening torque is still
applied and finally after the tightening torque is removed. The stress
element shown is in the shank.


An analysis of forces, torque, and thread geometry is required to derive
the relationship between the tightening torque and initial tension in a
screw. Turning a screw can be considered an equivalent to pushing an
object up an inclined plane. By unwinding one turn of the screw thread,
a geometrical relationship between the lead, lead angle, and diameter is

$$\tan \lambda  = \frac{L}{\pi d_m}$$

A segment of the nut or threaded material is represented in Figure \ldots{}
by the small block acted upon by load \(w\) (a portion of the total axial
load \(W\)), normal force \(n\), friction force \(f\), and tangential force
\(t\). Note that force \(t\) times \(d_m/2\) represents the torque applied to
the nut segment.

Summing tangential forces acting on the block gives

$$q - n(f\cos \lambda  + \cos \alpha_n\sin \lambda ) = 0$$

Summing axial forces gives

$$w + n(f\sin \lambda  - \cos \alpha_n\cos \lambda ) = 0$$

Combining
[[\#eqn: sum bolt tangent force]\ref{eqn: sum bolt tangent force}] and
[[\#eqn: sum bolt axial force]\ref{eqn: sum bolt axial force}] gives

$$q = w\frac{f\cos \lambda + \cos \alpha_n\sin \lambda }{\cos \alpha_n\cos \lambda  - f\sin \lambda }$$

Since the small block represents a typical segment of nut thread,
integration over the entire thread surface in contact results in the
same equations except the forces are now the \(total\) tangential,
vertical, and normal loads. The equation for torque required to create
tensile force \(W\) is

$$T = Q\frac{d_m}{2} = \frac{Wd_m}{2}\frac{f\cos \lambda + \cos \alpha_n\sin \lambda }{\cos \alpha_n\cos \lambda - f\sin \lambda }$$

The lead \(L\) rather than the lead angle \(\lambda\) is usually a known
standard value, a more convenient form of the torque equation is
obtained by dividing the numerator and denominator by \(\cos \lambda\) and
then substituting \(L/\pi d_m\) for \(\tan \lambda\). This gives

$$T = \frac{Wd_m}{2}\frac{f\pi d_m + L\cos \alpha_n}{\pi d_m\cos \alpha_n - fL}$$

If the coefficient of friction of the washer is \(f_c\), then the added
torque required to overcome collar friction is \(Wf_cd_c/2\), and the
total torque required to create tensile force \(W\) is

$$T = \frac{Wd_m}{2}\frac{f\pi d_m + L\cos \alpha_n}{\pi d_m\cos \alpha_n - fL} + \frac{Wf_cd_c}{2}$$

The analysis for torque required to remove the bolt is the same except
that the directions of applied tangential force \(q\) and friction \(f\) are
reversed. The total torque required to remove the bolt with tension \(W\)
is

$$T = \frac{Wd_m}{2}\frac{f\pi d_m - L\cos \alpha_n}{\pi d_m\cos \alpha_n + fL} + \frac{Wf_cd_c}{2}$$

An equation relating tightening torque to initial tension can be
obtained from
[[\#eqn: required bolt tightening torque]\ref{eqn: required bolt tightening torque}]
by substituting the both coefficients of friction with 0.15 as a rough
estimate. For standard screw threads, we have

$$T = 0.2F_id$$

where \(d\) is the nominal major diameter of the thread.

\section{Thread Loosening and Thread Locking}
\label{thread-loosening-and-thread-locking}
An inherent advantage of threaded fasteners in comparison with riveting
or welding is that they can be easily disassembled without destroying
the joints. A disadvantage is that they sometimes loosen and disassemble
themselves. Under static conditions, a self-locking screw is one that
requires a positive torque to lower then load, and an overhauling screw
is one that has low enough friction to enable the load to lower itself.
If collar friction can be neglected,
[[\#eqn: thread locking]\ref{eqn: thread locking}] for \(T \geqslant 0\)
shows that a screw is self-locking if

$$f \geqslant \frac{L\cos \alpha_n}{\pi d_m}$$

It is important to note that a self-locking screw under static
conditions may still loosen when exposed to vibration as the screw seeks
to relax its initial tension. The following factors can influence thread
loosening

\begin{enumerate}
\item Helix angle: larger helix angles allow for higher tendency of
loosening. Therefore, coarse threads tend to loosen more easily than
fine threads.

\item Initial tightening: greater initial tightening leads to larger
frictional force the must be overcome when loosening.

\item Clamping surfaces: Soft or rough clamping surfaces can promote
plastic deformation which decreases the initial tension and promotes
loosening.

\item Surface conditions: Surface treatments and conditions that increases
the friction coefficient provide increased resistance to loosening.
\end{enumerate}

In fact, the problem of thread loosening has resulted in numerous and
ingenious special designs and modifications. Some common solutions to
the problem include

\begin{enumerate}
\item Helical and toothed lock washers. They work on the principle of
biting into the mating metal surfaces and resist loosening by a
wedging action.

\item Slotted or castle nuts are used with a cotter pin or wire that fits
in diametrically opposite slots and passes through a drilled hole in
the bolt. This provides a positive lock but may require a slight
overtightening or undertightening in order to align a pair of slots
with the bolt hole.

\item Locknuts. There are generally two types---free-spinning and
prevailing torque. The free-spinning locknuts spin on freely until
seated and the produce a deflection when tightened that causes a
gripping of the mating bolt threads. The prevailing-torque locknuts
develop a friction torque as soon as the threads are fully engaged.
They require wrenching to the final seated position and have a strong
tendency to stay in position even when not tightened.
Prevailing-torque nuts or fasteners usually provide the best solution
in critical applications, particularly when extreme vibration is
involved.

\item Two standard nuts. Sometimes they can be used together to obtain a
locking action. The extra standard nut or is installed first and
tighten gently. Then the standard nut is installed and fully
tightened against the extra nut.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bolt Tension and Bolted Joint Stiffness}
\label{bolt-tension-and-bolted-joint-stiffness}
Bolts are typically used to hold parts together in opposition to forces
pulling or sliding them apart. Understanding load distribution between
the bolt and clamped parts is key to evaluating strength of a bolted
joint.

Upon tightening, the bolt starts to exert compressive load on the
clamped parts, and in the process the clamped parts exert tensile load
on the bolt. After initial tightening, the bolt is going to be in under
a tensile load \(F_i\) while the clamped parts are under an equal
compressive load. This load \(F_i\) is called the \emph{preload}.

In an event where there is an external axial load applied to the joint,
both the bolt and the clamped parts undergo axial deformation depending
on the load distributed between the two. One method of analyzing load
distribution in a bolted joint is to consider it as a compound bar.
Similar to a bolted joint, a compound bar is made of multiple materials
connected together in parallel, undergoing identical longitudinal
deformation. Recalling the formula for load distribution in a 2-member
compound bar, we have

$$ P_i = P_{ext}\frac{\dfrac{E_iA_i}{L_i}}{\dfrac{E_1A_1}{L_1} + \dfrac{E_2A_2}{L_2}}$$

where \(P_i\) is the load distributed in the ith member of the bar and \(P\)
is the axial load applied on the compound bar. Looking back at Hooke's
law, the term \(EA/L\) in fact represents the stiffness in axially loaded
member, for example,

$$\begin{gathered}
  \delta  = \frac{FL}{AE} = \frac{F}{k} \hfill \\
  k = \frac{EA}{L} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Rewriting [[\#eqn: 2-member compound bar]\ref{eqn: 2-member compound bar}]
using stiffnesses of the bolt \(k_b\) and of the clamped parts \(k_j\), the
new expression becomes


$$P_b = P\frac{k_b}{k_b + k_j}$$

This shows that the amount of external load distributed in the bolt and
clamped parts depends on their stiffness. The total loads carried in the
bolt and clamped parts are simply


\begin{align}
\label{eqn: bolt-joint interaction}
  F_b &= P_b + F_i = CP + F_i \\
  F_j &= (1 - C)P - F_i
\end{align}

where \(C = k_b/(k_b + k_j)\).

graphically represents the bolt-clamped-parts interaction. When there is
no external load (\(P\) = 0), there bolt and the clamped parts carry equal
and opposite load \(F_i\). When there is external load, the fraction of
the load distributed depend on their stiffnesses and simply add (or
subtract) from the original preload \(F_i\).

\subsection{Bolt Stiffness}
\label{bolt-stiffness}
The bolt stiffness \(k_b\) comes from the stifnesses of both the threaded
(\(k_t\) and unthreaded (\(k_u\)) parts that are engaged within the
thickness of the joint. The two parts are connected in series, hence the
bolt stiffness can be calculated using a formula for stiffness of two
serially connected members.

$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{1}{k_b} &= \frac{1}{k_u} + \frac{1}{k_{t}} \nonumber \\ 
  \frac{1}{k_b} &= \frac{L_u}{EA_u} + \frac{L_{t}}{EA_{t}} \nonumber \\ 
  k_b &= E\left( \frac{A_uA_{t}}{L_uA_{t} + L_{t}A_u} \right) \end{aligned}$$

For simplicity, the root diameter is assumed to be 0.9 times the major
diameter. If the bolt is threaded all the way through, the expression
for bolt stiffness reduces to

\begin{aligned}
  k_b = \frac{EA_t}{L} \approx \frac{\pi (0.9d)^2 E}{4L} \approx \frac{0.64d^2E}{L}
\label{eqn: bolt stiffness}
\end{aligned}

\subsection{Clamped Parts Stiffness}
\label{clamped-parts-stiffness}
Similar to bolt stiffness, the stiffness of clamped parts is analogous
to two (or more) serially connected springs. Let us consider two clamped
materials whose individual stiffnesses are \(k_1\) and \(k_2\),
respectively. Their combined stiffness is

$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{1}{k_j} &= \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2} \nonumber \\ 
  \frac{1}{k_j} &= \frac{L_1}{E_1A_1} + \frac{L_2}{E_2A_2}\end{aligned}$$

The same analogy can be applied for \(n\) parts clamped together, so that

$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{1}{k_j} &= \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2} + ... + \frac{1}{k_n} \nonumber \\ 
  \frac{1}{k_j} &= \frac{L_1}{E_1A_1} + \frac{L_2}{E_2A_2}+ ... + \frac{L_n}{E_nA_n} \end{aligned}$$

The effective cross-sectional area of the clamped parts can be difficult
to determine. In many cases, the effective area can be approximate by
drawing a cone 30-degree from the bolt head and nut outward and
calculate its average value throughout the clamped part thickness. The
bolt head diameter is approximately 1.5 times the major diameter of the
bolt. So the effective cross-sectional area of clamped parts, \(A_c\) can
be expressed as

\begin{aligned}
  A_c = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \left( \frac{d_3 + d_2}{2} \right)^2 - d_1^2 \right]
\label{eqn: clamped parts area}
\end{aligned}

where

$$\begin{aligned}
  d_1 &= d \\
  d_2 &= 1.5d \text{ for standard hexagonal-headed bolts} \\
  d_3 &= d_2 + L \tan 30^{\circ} \end{aligned}$$

Substitute these value in
[[\#eqn: clamped parts area]\ref{eqn: clamped parts area}] gives

\begin{align}
\label{eqn: clamped parts area approx}
  A_c &= \frac{\pi}{16}(5d^2 + 6dL \tan 30^{\circ} + L^2 \tan^2 30^{\circ}) \nonumber \\
      &\approx d^2 + 0.68dL + 0.065L^2 
\end{align}

In many bolted joints, the two (or more) clamped parts are made of the
same material. In such cases, the clamped part stiffness can be written
as

$$\begin{aligned}
  k_j = \frac{EA_c}{L_1+L_2}\end{aligned}$$

Determine the stiffness ratio \(C\) for a bolted joint made of two 1-cm
thick aluminum plates held together by an M8 bolt and nut. \(E_{Al}\) = 70
GPa and \(E_{steel}\) = 210 GPa.

First, start by determining the bolt stiffness. An M8 bolt obviously has
the diameter of 8 mm. We will assume that the bolt is threaded all the
way through. Utilizing [[\#eqn: bolt stiffness]\ref{eqn: bolt stiffness}],
we have

$$\begin{aligned}
    k_b &= \frac{0.64d^2E}{L} \\
        &= \frac{0.64 (0.008^2)(210 \times 10^9)}{0.01+0.01} \\
        &= 4.3 \times 10^8 \text{ N/m}
  \end{aligned}$$

To evaluate the clamped parts stiffness, we must determine their
effective cross-sectional area first. Using
[[\#eqn: clamped parts area approx]\ref{eqn: clamped parts area approx}],
we have that

$$\begin{aligned}
    A_c &\approx d^2 + 0.68dL + 0.065L^2 \\
        &= 0.008^2 + 0.68(0.008)(0.02) + 0.065(0.02)^2 \\
        &= 1.99 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2
  \end{aligned}$$

We can then determine the clamped parts stiffness.

$$\begin{aligned}
    k_j &= \frac{E_{Al}A_c}{L} \\
        &= \frac{70 \times 10^9 \times 1.99 \times 10^{-4}}{0.02} \\
        &= 6.97 \times 10^8 \text{ N/m}
  \end{aligned}$$

Finally, the stiffness ratio \(C\) is

$$\begin{aligned}
    C & = \frac{k_b}{k_b + k_j} = \frac{4.3}{4.3 + 6.97} \\
      &= 0.38
  \end{aligned}$$

Note that \(C\) in this example is larger than normal because the clamped
material (aluminum) is softer than the bolt (steel). In this case, it
may be advisable to use a washer to increase \(A_c\) and to increase the
clamped parts stiffness.

\section{Bolt Selection for Static Loading}
\label{bolt-selection-for-static-loading}
The primary loading applied to bolts is tensile, shear, or a combination
of the two. There may be some bending when the clamped parts are not
parallel or not perpendicular to the bolt axis. Before considering more
sophisticated examples, it is important to recognize that screws and
bolts are sometimes chosen arbitrarily. This is true for most
noncritical applications where loads are small in which case bolt size
selection is simply a matter of judgment and ease of assembly.

\subsection{Tension Joints}
\label{tension-joints}
The primary application of bolted joints is to exert compressive load on
clamped parts, thus preventing them from coming apart under external
tensile loads. In tension joints, the preload in the bolts directly
combat the external tensile loads.

From the bolt-joint stiffness interaction
[[\#eqn: bolt-joint interaction]\ref{eqn: bolt-joint interaction}], it is
clear that preload plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of
a bolted joint. By keeping the clamped parts intact, the bolted joint
distribute a small fraction of external load to the bolt, while the main
bulk of the load is carried by the clamped parts. If ever the clamping
force in the clamped parts become positive (no longer compressive), the
joint would separate. The bolt will have to carry the entire external
load, which usually breaks the bolt.

With that understanding, the required clamping force (and thus bolt
size) when an external tensile load \(P\) is applied can be determined by
making sure that the clamping force remains compressive (less than zero)
with the applied external load. Let us explore the external force that
leads to zero clamping load.

$$\begin{gathered}
  F_j = 0 = (1 - C)P - F_i \\ 
  P = \frac{F_i}{1 - C} \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

For non-permanent joints, the general guideline is that the preload
should approximately be 75\% of the bolt's proof load.

$$P = \frac{0.75F_p}{1 - C} = \frac{0.75S_pA_t}{1 - C}$$

For general bolt joint designs, it is safe to assume that the stiffness
ratio \(C\) is close to 0.25

$$\begin{gathered}
  P = \frac{0.75S_pA_t}{1 - 0.25} = S_pA_t \\ 
  A_t = \frac{P}{S_p} \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

For the bolted joint to have a safety factor of \(N_s\)

$$\label{eqn: tension joint bolt sizing}
  A_t = \frac{N_sP}{S_p}$$

\subsection{Friction Joints}
\label{friction-joints}
Another application for bolted joints is to prevent clamped parts from
sliding apart under shear forces. It is a common misconception that
bolted joints can prevent such sliding by the interference of bolts or
screws, as in the case of pins. Bolted joints rely friction between the
parts to prevent them from sliding. The only contribution bolts makes to
friction joints is the preload which increases friction between clamped
parts. Therefore, the maximum shear force capacity \(P_{shear}\) of a
friction joint is


$$P_{shear} = -\mu F_j$$

where \(\mu\) is the coefficient of friction between clamped parts and
\(F_j\) is the clamping force on the parts. The negative sign is there to
correct the sign: friction is generated only when clamping force is
compressive (\(F_j < 0\)), and for later calculation it is more convenient
if friction comes out positive.

Typically, when the friction joint is not also loaded in tensile
direction, the clamping force is equal to the preload. However, when the
joint is loaded in the tensile direction, the clamping force is changed.
Taking the same assumptions for tension joints (preload is approximately
75\% of proof load and stiffness ratio is 0.25), the expression for shear
force capacity of the joint is

$$\begin{aligned}
  P_{shear} &= -\mu F_j = -\mu \left( P(1 - C) - F_i \right) \\
            &= \mu (0.75S_pA_t - 0.75P)\end{aligned}$$

For the friction joint to have a safety factor of \(N_s\), the potential
friction force generated by the bolted joint must be Ns times the
external shear force.

$$N_s = \frac{\mu F_j}{P_{shear}} = \frac{0.75\mu (S_pA_t - P)}{P_{shear}}$$

Therefore, the required tensile area of the bolt is

$$A_t = \frac{\dfrac{N_s P_{shear}}{0.75\mu } + P}{S_p}$$

Upon closer inspection of the equation, the required tensile area is
simply the sum of the areas for a friction joint without external load
\(P\) and tension joint under load \(P\).

$$A_t = \frac{N_s P_{shear}}{0.75\mu S_p } + \frac{P}{S_p}$$

An bracket is attached to a wall with a bolts. The bracket, during
operation, will be subjected to a load as shown in the figure. Determine
the required bolt size if the safety factor of the joint is 2 and the
coefficient of friction between the bracket and the wall is 0.5.


In this problem, the load applies both a tensile and shear loads onto
the joint. We must consider bolt sizing equations for both tension and
friction joints to determine the proper answer.

Let us first consider the joint as a tension joint, the horizontal
component of the 2000-N load is one applying the tensile load. If we
pick material SAE grade 4.8 for our bolts, the proper sizing is

$$\begin{aligned}
    A_t &= \frac{N_s P}{S_p} \\
        &= \frac{(2)(2000 \sin 30^{\circ})}{225 \times 10^6} \\
        &= 8.89 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^2 = 8.89 \text{ mm}^2
  \end{aligned}$$

Looking back at
[[\#table: ISO Screw Dimensions]\ref{table: ISO Screw Dimensions}], this
calls for an M5\$\texttimes{}\$0.8 bolt.

Now, let us consider the joint as a friction joint, the vertical
component is the shearing load, and the horizontal component is the
tensile load, the proper bolt size is

$$\begin{aligned}
    A_t &= \frac{\dfrac{N_s P_{shear}}{0.75\mu } + P}{S_p} \\
        &= \frac{\dfrac{2(2000 \cos 30^{\circ})}{0.75(0.5)} + 2000 \sin 30^{\circ}}{225 \times 10^6} \\
        &= 4.55 \times 10^{-5} = 45.5 \text{ mm}^2
  \end{aligned}$$

The smallest bolt with \(A_t\) of at least 45.5 mm\(^2\) is M10\$\texttimes{}\$1.5
or M10\$\texttimes{}\$1.25. Since this is larger than the M5 answer for the
tension joint, M10 bolt is the answer.

\subsection{Flange Joints}
\label{flange-joints}
Flange joints are joints in which bolts are arranged in circular arrays.
They are typically employed for pressure vessels and pipe connections.
These joints provide good sealing capability when used with gaskets or
O-rings. These joints are in fact tension joints because internal
pressure \(P_{int}\), when higher than atmospheric pressure \(P_{atm}\),
exerts tensile loads, and thus bolt sizing equations for tension joints
apply to flange joints as well. And there is an additional rule to guide
bolt spacing in flange joints.


$$3 \leqslant \frac{\pi D_b}{Nd} \leqslant 6$$

This expression essentially states that bolt spacing should be between 3
and 6 bolt diameters. The lower limit provides sufficient wrench
clearance for assembly and disassembly. The upper limit provides
sufficient clamped area coverage along the circumference of the flange
joint.

Bolt sizing for a flange joint on a pressure vessel

A cylindrical pressure vessel is pressurized to 10 MPa. The cross
section of the vessel is shown below. The flange joint to keep the cover
on the vessel is made up of 12 grade 12.9 M8 coarse thread bolts. Is
this joint safe? If not, determine the proper bolt size.


In this problem, there is no specification about changes in the
pressure, so it is assumed that the pressure is constant and the load is
static. Most bolts are ductile and so the proper safety factor is 1.5 --
\begin{enumerate}
\item We will use 2 in this problem, just to be safe. Using sizing equation
\end{enumerate}
for bolts to determine proper bolt tensile area, we have

$$A_t = \frac{PN_s}{S_p}$$

The vertical load comes from the pressure force, which is

$$P_{total} = p\pi r^2 = 10 \times 10^6 \times \pi  \times 0.5^2 = 7.85\text{ MN}$$

We will assume that the load is distributed evenly on all 12 bolts, so
that

$$P = \frac{P_{total}}{N} = \frac{7.85 \text{ MN}}{12} = 6.54 \times
  {10^5}\text{ N}$$

Assume that we use the bolt material grade 12.9 whose proof strength is
970 MPa, the required tensile area is

$$A_t = \frac{4(0.2)(6.54 \times 10^5)(2)}{970 \times 10^6} = 1.08 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^2$$

The calculated required tensile area, even with the strongest material
(grade 12.9), is larger than M8 coarse thread (36.6 mm2) and therefore
the given design is unsafe!

Redesigning the flange joint, it must satisfy the sizing equation above
and the bolt distance equation, namely

$$3 \leqslant \frac{\pi D_b}{Nd} \leqslant 6$$

Since the diameter of the bolt around the joint is 150 cm, we replace
the inequality by letting the quotient term be equal to 4.5.

$$\begin{gathered}
  \frac{\pi D_b}{Nd} = 4.5 \hfill \\
  Nd = 1.05 \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Reapply the tension joint equation to determine the total required
tensile area, we have

$$\begin{aligned}
  NA_t &= \frac{N_sP}{S_p} = \frac{2(7.85 \times 10^6)}{970 \times 10^6} \\
         &= 1.62 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}^2\end{aligned}$$

Note that at the moment, the system of equations we are attempting to
solve have two equations and three unknowns (\(N\), \(A_t\), and \(d\)).
However, the tensile area and the diameter obviously are not
independent. By assuming the choice of fine-threaded bolts, a simplified
relationship between bolt tensile area and diameter can be written to
solve this system of equations.

$$\begin{gathered}
  A_t \approx 0.8\frac{\pi }{4}d^2 \\ 
  NA_t \approx N(0.8)\frac{\pi}{4}d^2 = 1.62 \times 10^{-2} \\ 
  Nd^2 = 2.58 \times 10^{-2} \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Solving the system of equations, we have

$$\frac{Nd^2}{Nd} = \frac{2.58 \times 10^{-2}}{1.05} = 0.0245 \text{ m} = 24.5 \text{ mm}$$

Since there is no standard bolts with that size, we pick the next larger
bolt, M27 \(\times\) 2 (fine thread). Finally, \(A_t\) = 496 mm\(^2\) (from
M27) is used to solve for the number of required bolts.

$$N = \frac{1.62 \times 10^{-2}}{496 \times 10^{-6}} = 25.4$$

Therefore, we need 26 M27 \(\times\) 2 for this flange joint.

\section{Bolt Selection for Fatigue Loading}
\label{bolt-selection-for-fatigue-loading}
Fatigue in bolts is caused by fluctuating tension. In this section,
principles of fatigue covered in section 4.2 is applied to bolts.
However, experimental data show that, when tightened properly, bolt
dynamic load capacity tends to be insensitive to the average load. In
other words, their fatigue strengths (aka endurance limits) are mostly
independent of their preloads. illustrates the endurance limits of bolt
materials from grade 8.8 through 12.9.


 L3cm C4cm Material Grade \& Endurance Limit (\(S_e\))\\
8.8 \& 129 MPa\\
9.8 \& 140 MPa\\
10.9 \& 162 MPa\\
12.9 \& 190 MPa\\

In addition, stress concentration is always present at the thread roots.
gives approximate values of fatigue stress concentration factor \(K_f\)
for standard screw and bolts. Note that rolled threads have lower values
of \(K_f\) because of work hardening and residual stresses and hardened
threads have higher values of \(K_f\) because of their greater notch
sensitivity.

 L3cm C3cm C2.5cm C2.5cm C2.5cm Hardness \& SAE Grade (Unified Threads) \&
SAE Class (ISO Threads) \& \(K_f\) Rolled threads \& \(K_f\) Cut threads\\
Below 200 Bhn (annealed) \& 2 and below \& 5.8 and below \& 2.2 \& 2.8\\
Above 200 Bhn (hardened) \& 4 and above \& 8.8 and above \& 3.0 \& 3.8\\

Preload is especially important in bolted joints under fatigue loading
because of the following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The dynamic load on the bolt is reduced because the effective area of
the clamped parts is larger.

\item There is maximum protection against overloads which cause the joint
to separate.

\item There is maximum protection against thread loosening.
\end{enumerate}

It is important to recognize that small amount of thread root yielding
occurs when bolts are tightened to the full proof load is not harmful.

\subsection{Bolt sizing for a flange joint under fatigue loading}
\label{sec:org85740d8}

Using the same cylindrical pressure vessel from
but the vessel is pressurized and depressurized repeatedly between 0 and
10 MPa during its operation. Design a proper flange joint with a safety
factor of 2.

This problem is clearly fatigue related since the internal pressure
varies. We need to find the range of external load and corresponding
stress to determine the required fatigue strength of the flange joint.
According to \ldots{}, the load exerted by the internal pressure of 200 bar is 7.85 MN.
Obviously, the load exerted by the internal pressure of 0 bar is 0 N.
The stress amplitude can then be calculated.

$$\begin{aligned}
  \sigma_{\max } &= \frac{CK_fP_{\max}}{NA_t} = \frac{0.25(3)(7.85 \times 10^6}{NA_t} = \frac{5.89 \times 10^6}{NA_t} \\ 
  \sigma_{\min } &= 0 \\ 
  \sigma_a&= \frac{2.94 \times 10^{-6}}{NA_t} \end{aligned}$$

In this problem, let us choose bolts made of grade 12.9 (rolled threads)
as we did in \ldots{}, whose endurance limit is 190 MPa. This is to provide a comparison
between bolt sizing under static and fatigue loadings. The design
requires the safety factor of 2, so the required bolt area is

$$\begin{gathered}
  N_s = 2 = \frac{S_e}{\sigma_a} = \frac{190 \times 10^6}{\frac{2.94 \times 10^6}{NA_t}} \hfill \\
  NA_t = 3.10 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}^2 \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

The joint must also be checked for yielding under tensile load. In this
case, we can use the sizing equation for tension joint. This has already
been calculated in \ldots{} so that

$$NA_t = \frac{N_sP}{S_p} = \frac{2(7.85 \times 10^6)}{970 \times 10^6} = 1.62 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}^2$$

In this case, the fatigue loading (which requires larger bolt tensile
area) is the deciding factor. Setting the bolt spacing inequality to
solve the system of equations, we have

$$\begin{gathered}
  \frac{\pi D_b}{Nd} = 4.5 \hfill \\
  Nd = 1.05 \hfill  \end{gathered}$$

We can then solve for the required diameter,

$$\begin{gathered}
  NA_t = N(0.8)\frac{\pi }{4}d^2 = 3.10 \times 10^{-2} \hfill \\
  Nd^2 = 4.93 \times 10^{-2} \hfill \\
  \frac{Nd^2}{Nd} = \frac{4.93 \times 10^{-2}}{1.05} = 0.047 \text{ m} \hfill\end{gathered}$$

The required bolts are then M48 \(\times\) 5, and the required number of
bolts is

$$N = \frac{3.10 \times 10^{-2}}{1473 \times 10^{-6}} = 21$$

So we would need 21 M48 \(\times\) 5 bolts.

\section{Increasing Bolted Joint Fatigue Strength}
\label{increasing-bolted-joint-fatigue-strength}
There are many helpful design guidelines to improve bolt fatigue
strength.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Modify stiffness to decrease the portion of the external load that
increases bolt tension.

\item Modify the nut to equalize the load carried by the several threads in
contact.

\item Reduce the thread root stress concentration by using a larger root
radius.

\item Use a material of highest practical proof strength in order to obtain
maximum initial tension.

\item Tighten the bolt so that its initial tension is as close as possible
to its proof load.

\item If possible, select threads that are rolled after heat treatment.

\item Prevent partial loss of initial tension by retightening and
replacement of overused bolts.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary}
\label{summary-7}
Bolted joints are, in most cases, non-permanent joints that utilize
clamping force in order to enhance the strength of bolt-clamped parts
system. It is crucial to understand that preload plays a significant
role in both tension and friction joints. In tension joints, preload
does not simply keep the members together but distribute the majority of
any external prying force to the members. In friction joint, it increase
the potential of friction between members, providing protection against
shearing or sliding forces. Other considerations such as self-locking,
member stiffness, and fatigue loads are considered as well.

\chapter{Machine Components Interrelationships}
\label{machine-components-interrelationships}
The goal of any mechanical component is so that each of them come
together to form a machine that serves a useful purpose. The design of a
machine takes imagination and creative processes to determine the proper
combination of components, optimization of said components, and to take
into consideration a multitude of internal and external factors that
apply to specific design problems. Making a progress from component
design to sub-system and system design requires deeper knowledge and
even more profound experiences.

The purpose of this chapter is to help us make that progress by
demonstrating the decisions involved in designing a few simple machines
that can be seen in day-to-day lives. By observing and studying the way
a design of one component affect that of another, the examples should
start us on thinking about machine design as a network of
interconnected, interdependent processes.

\section{Processes of Mechanism Analysis}
\label{processes-of-mechanism-analysis}
At component design level, a designer has often already established
requirements and overall shapes of the intended mechanism. In order to
design specific components, we usually follow these steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Establish most extreme operating conditions. This normally leads to
the maximum loads on the mechanism, including but not limited to any
repeated and impact loadings.

\item Determine load in each component. With free body diagram and method
of sections, forces, moments, and torques applied on each of the
components can be calculated.

\item Analyze stresses and safety factors. Determine the type of
deformation caused by the loads and determine the stresses. A
designer can then narrow down on material selection and dimensions
for each component to obtain proper a safety factor without
compromising other non-mechanical requirements.
\end{enumerate}

Further theoretical discussions beyond this point about machine
component interaction holds little benefit. Instead, let us take a look
at a few simple mechanisms and apply the discussed procedures in
analyzing/designing them.

\section{Design of a Simple Weight Scale}
\label{design-of-a-simple-weight-scale}
A traditional weight scale is composed of a horizontal lever, a column,
and two scale pans suspending from each end of the lever by chains. The
lever is connected to the column by a cylindrical pin. To use the scale,
put an unknown weight on one scale pan and a known weight (called a
counterweight) on the other to balance the scale. In this quiz, you will
need to analyze three components: the lever, the column, and the pin. We
will assume that the scale pans and chains cannot be broken.


Assume that the column and lever are made of 6061-T4 Aluminum and the
pin is made of AISI 4027 steel. The lever is 20 cm long and has a cross
section of 1 cm \(\times\) 1 cm. The column is 30 cm long and has a cross
section of 1 cm \(\times\) 1 cm. The cylindrical pin has a radius of 0.3
cm and is 2 cm long. It is inserted into the same size holes drilled
into the lever and the column. The material properties are as follows.

Calculate the maximum weight \(W\) that the balance can measure. Ignore
the effect of stress concentration and the weights of other components
besides the unknown weight and the counterweight. The column supports
can be thought of as \emph{fixed} to the ground and \emph{free} at the top.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Solution
\label{solution}
First, we need to construct a free body diagram for each component.
Assuming that the maximum weight that the scale can measure without
failure is \(W\), the free body diagram of each component is as follows.


We can now analyze each component.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Lever
\label{lever}
The lever is under bending and is most likely to fail from bending
stress. The maximum bending stress occurs at the top and bottom surfaces
at the middle.

$$\sigma  = \frac{My}{I} = \frac{W(0.1)(0.01/2)}{(0.01^4/12)} = 6 \times
  10^4W$$

We can then determine the maximum allowable weight for the lever
\(W_{lever}\) using MNST with safety factor = 1 (since the material is
brittle and safety factor is not specified) as

$$\begin{gathered}
  N_s\text{(MNST)} = 1 = \frac{S_{ut}}{\sigma _{1,2}} \hfill \\
  240 \times {10^6} = 6 \times 10^4W_{lever} \hfill \\
  W_{lever} = 4000\text{ N} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

\item Pin
\label{pin}
The pin is under shearing load, which results in pure shear. Since the
material is ductile, we will use MDET to determine \(W_{pin}\).

$$\begin{gathered}
  N_s\text{(MDET)} = 1 = \frac{S_y}{\sigma_e} \hfill \\
  425 \times 10^6 = \sqrt {3\left( \frac{2W_{pin}}{\pi (3 \times 10^{-3})^2} \right)^2}  \hfill \\
  W_{pin} = 9.23 \times 10^5\text{ N} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

\item Column
\label{column}
The column, which is under a compressive load, can fail due to either
excessive compressive stress or buckling. Let us first consider
compressive stress.

The problem did not specify the ultimate compressive strength of 6061-T4
Al, so we can assume that it is identical to the ultimate tensile
strength. We can then determine \(W_{column}\) to be

$$\begin{gathered}
  N_s\text{(MNST)} = 1 = \frac{S_{ut}}{\sigma_{1,2}} \hfill \\
  240 \times 10^6 = \frac{2W_{lever}}{0.01^2} \hfill \\
  W_{lever} = 12000\text{ N} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Now, let us consider buckling.

$$\begin{gathered}
  2W_{column} = P_c = \frac{\pi ^2EI}{(2L)^2} \hfill \\
  W_{column} = \frac{\pi ^2(70 \times 10^9)(0.01^4/12)}{2(2 \times 0.3)^2} \hfill \\
  W_{column} = 800\text{ N} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

The smallest weight that can cause failure to a component of the scale
is 800 N, which is the maximum weight that this scale can measure.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Design of a Bicycle Tire Pump}
\label{design-of-a-bicycle-tire-pump}
    Consider a bicycle tire pump as shown in
[[\#fig: bike pump]\ref{fig: bike pump}]. It is operated by pushing
straight down on the handle attached on the top of a shaft. A piston
attached on the other end of the shaft moves down, compressing and
forcing air in the chamber through the tube into a bicycle tire.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{A bicycle tire pump.}
  \label{fig: bike pump}
\end{figure}

To analyze the pump, we will make the following simplifications.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The handle is a 30-cm long cylinder with constant cross section. Its
radius is 1 cm.

\item The shaft is a 60-cm long cylinder with the cross-sectional radius of
0.5 cm.

\item The chamber is a thin-walled cylindrical pressure vessel with the
base radius of 1.5 cm and thickness of 0.05 cm.

\item The piston (hidden inside the chamber) and the stand are very strong
and do not factor into our analysis.

\item The piston is a circular disc with the same radius as the chamber.

\item During operation, the operator pushes using his weight (assumed 500 N
each on the left and right hands) at the left and right ends of the
handle and the internal pressure in the chamber pushes up against the
piston to balance the downward force on the handle.

\item Once the air inside the chamber has been forced out, the user simply
lift the handle bar, which also lifts the piston and shaft up with
very small force (upward force = 0). The operator repeat 6 and 7
until the tire is properly pressurized.

\item All components can be considered massless.
\end{enumerate}

The handle is made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), the shaft is
made of steel, and the chamber is made of aluminum. The materials have
the following properties.


 L6cm C2cm C2cm C2cm Material \& HDPE \& Steel \& Aluminum\\
Material Type \& Brittle \& Ductile \& Ductile\\
Young's Modulus (GPa) \& 1 \& 200 \& 70\\
Yield Strength (MPa) \& 50 \& 200 \& 100\\
Ultimate Tensile Strength (MPa) \& 100 \& 300 \& 150\\

Determine the following on all components in consideration (handle,
shaft, and chamber):

\begin{enumerate}
\item Free-body diagram indicating load(s) (both direction and magnitude)
when the operator is pushing down on the handle.

\item Type of deformation occurring to the component.

\item Critical point.

\item Stresses.

\item Safety factor using an appropriate theory.

\item Safety factor of the chamber using Soderberg theory.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Solution
\label{solution-1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We will assume that during operation, all components are in
equilibrium so that the sum of forces and/or moments on them are
zeroes. First, consider the handle. The handle has two downward
forces, each applying on either end of the handle. It is supported by
the shaft which pushes up with equal and opposite force in the middle
so that
\end{enumerate}


The shaft is simply taking the compressive force from the handle, and
also taking an equal and opposite force from the piston


Finally, the chamber, as the problem states, is a pressure vessel, so
its main load is the pressurized air. The pressure is equal to the
force applied by the piston divided by its area, which is

$$p = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{1000 \text{ N}}{\pi (0.015)^2} = 1.4 \text{ MPa}$$

There is no other external force applied to the chamber, so we have
that


\begin{enumerate}
\item The types of deformation for the handle, shaft, and chamber are
bending, compressive axial, and pressure vessel.

\item For the handle, it should be obvious by now that the critical point
is where the maximum bending moment is, which is at the middle of the
handle. Given that there is no axial load on the handle, the stresses
at the top and bottom surfaces at the middle will be identical, so
both are in fact critical points.

For the shaft, the compressive stress is uniform throughout the
material, so the critical point is everywhere. \emph{Buckling} is in fact
more of a concern in this case.

For the chamber, the circumferential and longitudinal stress are not
dependent on the location (since the internal pressure is the same
everywhere), so the critical point is also everywhere.

\item The bending stress in the handle is

$$\sigma = \frac{My}{I} = \frac{(500 \text{ N})(0.15 \text{ m})(0.01 \text{ m})}{\dfrac{\pi }{4}{(0.01 \text{ m})^4}} = 95.5 \text{ MPa}$$

The compressive stress in the shaft is

$$\sigma = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{1000 \text{ N}}{\pi (0.005)^2} = 12.7 \text{ MPa}$$

The circumferential and longitudinal stresses in the chamber's wall
are

$$\begin{gathered}
     \sigma_c = \frac{pr}{t} = \frac{(1.4 \text{ MPa})(0.015)}{(0.0005 \text{ m})} = 42 \text{ MPa} \hfill \\
     \sigma_l = \frac{pr}{2t} = 21 \text{ MPa} \hfill \\ 
   \end{gathered}$$

Note that there are no shear stresses in any of the component,
therefore the normal stresses found are also principal stresses.

\item The handle is made of HDPE, which is a brittle material, hence its
safety factor is defined using a maximum normal stress theory as

$$N_s = \frac{S_{ut}}{\sigma_1} = \frac{100\text{ MPa}}{95.5\text{ MPa}} = 1.05$$

The shaft is a long slender column under compressive load, buckling
is typically the main source of failure. The shaft can be considered
fixed at the bottom as it is usually welded or attached to the
piston, allowing very little translation or rotation, and free on the
top as the handle bar is free to move.

$$\begin{aligned}
     N_s &= \frac{P_{cr}}{P} = \frac{\dfrac{\pi ^2 EI}{L_e^2}}{1000\text{ N}} \\[0.5em] 
         &= \frac{\dfrac{\pi ^2 (200 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}) \left( \dfrac{\pi }{4}(0.005\text{ m})^4 \right)}{(2 \times 0.6\text{ m})^2}}{1000\text{ N}} \\[0.5em] 
         &= 0.67\end{aligned}$$

The chamber is made of a ductile material. Its safety factor may be
determined using the maximum distortion energy theory (von Mises
criteria) or the maximum shear stress theory (Tresca criteria). In
this problem, we will choose the von Mises criteria, whose safety
factor is defined by

$$N_s = \frac{S_y}{\sigma_e} = \frac{100\text{ MPa}}{\sqrt {42^2 - (42)(21) + 21^2}} = 2.75$$

\item To determine the safety factor due to fatigue, the maximum and
minimum stresses during a loading cycle must be calculated. The
maximum stress in the chamber happens when the piston is being pushed
down, compressing the air. The minimum stress happens when the piston
is being lifted. The problem states that the lift force is assumed
very small (zero), resulting in zero air pressure and zero stress on
the chamber wall. Therefore, the fatigue stress amplitude goes
between 42 MPa and 0 MPa, giving the mean stress of 21 MPa. Since the
mean stress is nonzero, Soderberg theory must be used to determine
the safety factor.

$$\frac{\sigma _m}{S_y} + \frac{\sigma _a}{S_e} = \frac{1}{N_s}$$

The endurance limit of aluminum at zero mean stress for pressure
vessel loading is not available. To be safe, it can be assumed that
it is the smallest among the available cases, which is torsion, so
that

$$S_e = 0.29S _{ut} = 0.29(150\text{ MPa}) = 43.5\text{ MPa}$$

Using Soderberg theory to determine the safety factor, we have

$$\begin{gathered}
         \frac{1}{N_s} = \left( \frac{21\text{ MPa}}{100\text{ MPa}} + \frac{21\text{ MPa}}{43.5\text{ MPa}} \right) \hfill \\
         N_s = 1.44 \hfill \\ 
       \end{gathered}$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Design of a Chest Exercise Equipment}
\label{design-of-a-chest-exercise-equipment}
Chest exercise equipment is composed of two identical springs attached
to a spring plate at each end. The user simply pulls on the handles and
stretch the springs to exercise. A schematic drawing of the equipment is
show below. The maximum pulling force allowed is 700 N and the
unstretched spring is 1 m long. Using a safety factor of 2, answer the
following questions.



\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the proper spring to be used.

\item If the spring plates are to be welded to the handle and the weld
effective throat thickness is 5 mm, determine the proper electrode
and weld length.

\item If the spring plates are to be attached to the handle using 2
identical bolts. Determine the proper bolt size.
\end{enumerate}

Note: Assume any other values or dimensions you think are necessary to
solve the problem.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Solution
\label{solution-2}
The problem did not mention the maximum stretched length of the spring.
However, this is a chest exercise machine and its reasonable maximum
length should approximately be of a length of an average human reach,
say 1.5 m. We can calculate the required spring stiffness.

$$k = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x} = \frac{350 - 0}{1.5 - 1} = 700\text{ N/m}$$

The springs used here should be extension spring since the exercise
machine will mainly receive pulling loads.

For these extension springs, there are no requirements for resistances
against shock load or corrosive environment. Cost, therefore, become the
main criterion for material selection. In this problem, we will pick the
inexpensive \emph{hard-drawn} wire, from which the equations for the required
diameter are

$$\begin{gathered}
  \sigma_{\max} = \frac{16FD}{\pi d^3}\left( \frac{r_1}{r_3} \right) = \frac{16FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{r_1}{r_3} \right) \hfill \\
  \tau_{\max} = \frac{8FD}{\pi d^3}\left( \frac{r_4}{r_2} \right) = \frac{8FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{r_4}{r_2} \right) \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

According to
[[\#eqn: critical stresses in end hook]\ref{eqn: critical stresses in end hook}],
\(r_1 = D / 2\), \(r_3 = (D - d) / 2\). Let us also assume that
\(r_4 = D / 3\), which gives \(r_2 = D / 3 - d / 2\). For a relatively low
stiffness spring, we will assume that the spring index \(C\) = 8, which
allows us to solve for \(d\).

$$\begin{gathered}
  \sigma_{\max} = \frac{S_{ut}}{N_s} = \frac{16FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{r_1}{r_3} \right) = \frac{16FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{D}{D - d} \right) \\
  \frac{1}{2}\frac{A}{d^m} = \frac{16FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{C}{C - 1} \right) \\ 
  \frac{1}{2}\frac{1783 \times 10^6 \times 10^{-3(0.190)}}{d^{0.190}} = \frac{16(350)(8)(8)}{\pi d^2(8 - 1)} \\
  \begin{aligned}
  &d^{2-0.190} = 6.79 \times 10^{-5} \\ 
  &d = 4.98 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} = 4.98\text{ mm}
  \end{aligned}\end{gathered}$$

$$\begin{gathered}
  \tau_{\max} = \frac{\tau_{allow}}{N_s} = \frac{8FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{r_4}{r_2} \right) = \frac{8FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{D/3}{D/3 - d/2} \right) \\ 
  \frac{0.45}{2}\frac{A}{d^m} = \frac{8FC}{\pi d^2}\left( \frac{C/3}{C/3 - 1/2} \right) \\ 
  \frac{0.45}{2}\frac{1783 \times 10^6 \times 10^{-3(0.190)}}{d^{0.190}} = \frac{8(350)(8)(8/3)}{\pi d^2(8/3 - 1/2)} \\
  \begin{aligned}
  &d^{2-0.190} = 8.13 \times 10^{-5} \\ 
  &d = 5.50 \times 10^{-3}\text{ m} = 5.50 \text{ mm}
  \end{aligned}\end{gathered}$$

In this problem, the limiting factor is the shear stress (since it
requires the larger of the two diameters). Therefore, the wire diameter
\(d\) = 5.50 mm, which gives the coil diameter \(D = Cd\) = 4.4 cm. Finally,
the number of required active coils is

$$N_a = \frac{Gd}{8C^3k} = \frac{79.3 \times 10^9(5.5 \times 10^{-3})}{8(8^3)(700)} = 152\text{ coils}$$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary}
\label{summary-8}
This chapter discusses the application of concepts from Statics and
Mechanics of Materials to analyze loads and stress on assembled
mechanism. Students must understand how exerted loads transfer through
materials and joints and translate them into corresponding stresses.
Components are not designed solely to satisfy its requirements but those
of the entire mechanism.

\section{Exercises}
\label{exercises-8}
[lab:\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{exercisesi}] Design of a Swing Set.

A swing set consists of 4 legs, 1 top beam, 2 side bars, and 2 swings is
set up in a park for children to play with. The legs are 2-m long
circular tubes with inner diameter of 5 cm and outer diameter of 5.5 cm.
The top beam is a 2-m long solid 4 cm \(\times\) 4 cm cross sectioned
beam. The side bars are 1-m solid cylindrical cross sectioned bars with
diameter of 3 cm. The legs, top beam, and side bars are assembled as
shown.

The two swings are hoisted from the top beam at 0.5 m from the left and
right ends of the beam as shown. Assume that the bottom parts of the
legs are \emph{fixed} at the ground and the top parts is \emph{free}, while the
top beam and side beams can be considered as \emph{simply supported} at both
ends.

To simplify the analysis, we will assume that the children will only be
sitting still on the two swings, that the 2 swings cannot be broken, and
that all legs, top beam, and side bars are massless. If the two children
weigh 300 N each, what is the safety factor of this swing set? Note that
you may ignore failure due to fatigue of the swing set.

All beams, bars, and legs are made of AISI1020. Young's modulus = 210
GPa, yield strength = 400 MPa.

[lab:\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{exercisesi}] Design of a Spring Weight
Scale.

A spring weight scale consists of 2 identical springs, a scale housing,
a hook and 2 plates, one permanently joined to the hook, another
permanently joined to the springs. The spring stretches when measuring
an unknown weight, and at its end there is an arrow pointing to the
side, indicating weight. The weight scale maximum measurable weight is
1000 N. To improve the resolution of the scale, for every 100 N, the
indicators should be 2 cm apart. Using a safety factor of 3, do the
followings.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Design the 2 identical springs.

\item If you plan to join the 2 plates using 2 identical pairs of bolts and
nuts, determine the proper bolt sizes.

\item Determine a proper weld length for electrode series E60XX if the
effective throat thickness is 3 mm.
\end{enumerate}

Note: Reasonably assume any other parameters that are not provided where
you deem necessary to calculate the solutions. Assume that the housing,
plates, and hook are indestructible.

[lab:\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{exercisesi}] Let us consider a bicycle
pedal system, shown below with the name of each component.

\url{pictures/Machine-interaction/pedal-system}
\url{pictures/Machine-interaction/pedal}

In this problem, we will be considering the crank and supporting rod.
For simplicity sake, assume that the crank is a \emph{solid square}
cross-sectioned, 20-cm long bar. The pedal is composed of the flat pedal
itself and the supporting rod fixing to the crank. The supporting rod is
\emph{solid circular} cross-sectioned, 10-cm long bar. The crank and
supporting rod have the following properties

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
Component & Crank & Supporting Rod\\
\hline
Material & AISI 1023 & HDPE\\
Material type & Ductile & Brittle\\
\emph{E} (GPa) & 200 & 10\\
Yield Strength (MPa) & 300 & 50\\
Ultimate Tensile Stress (MPa) & 450 & 60\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

During operation, the crank rotates about the crank bolt in a clockwise
direction, while supporting rod rotating with the crank. Assume that the
cyclist can generate a constant force of 3000 N downward at the middle
of the supporting rod from when the crank is at 0\(^{\circ}\) (pointing
upward) until the crank is at 180\(^{\circ}\) (pointing downward), and
that there is no force applied on the supporting rod from 180\(^{\circ}\)
to 0\(^{\circ}\).

We want to design the crank and supporting rod to have a safety factor
of 3 and 2.5, respectively. Ignore the effect of stress concentration.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw free body diagrams of the crank and supporting rod when the
crank is at 0\(^{\circ}\), 90\(^{\circ}\), 180\(^{\circ}\), and
270\(^{\circ}\).

\item Determine the proper cross sections for the crank and supporting rod
considering only static loadings.

\item Determine the proper cross sections for the crank and supporting rod
considering repeated loadings.
\end{enumerate}

[lab:\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{exercisesi}] A pogo stick is a toy for
which the user stands on the pedal, holds on to the handle, and jumps up
and down using a compression spring inside the mechanism. The components
of a typical pogo stick are as follows.

\url{pictures/Machine-interaction/pogostick-compress}

Marketing team has researched the target group demands and submitted the
following requirements to Engineering team.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The length of the components should be as illustrated in
[[\#fig1]\ref{fig1}].

\item The handle should be a hollow tube, and to provide proper grip, the
outer diameter of the tube should be 3 cm. The material for the
handle is aluminum alloy 6061-T6 whose \(E\) = 70 GPa, \(S_y\) = 250 MPa,
and \(S_{ut}\) = 300 MPa.

\item The spring should be made of chrome-vanadium with a wire diameter \(d\)
of 8 mm. Its free length is 50 cm, and when a 80-kg user on the pogo
stick land on the floor from a 1-m high jump, the spring should
contract by 20 cm, as shown in [[\#fig4]\ref{fig4}].

\item The top of the piston is held in place by a bolt ([[\#fig2]\ref{fig2}]),
which clamps it between the two columns. The coefficient of friction
\(\mu\) between the surfaces is 0.25.

\item When the maximum load is applied (downward forces of 300 N on each
end of the handle bar, and the downward forces of 600 N on each end
of the pedal) as shown in [[\#fig3]\ref{fig3}], all load bearing
components (handle and bolted joint) should have the safety factor of
2.5, while the spring should have a safety factor of 1.25.
\end{enumerate}


\url{pictures/Machine-interaction/pogostick-load}

Design the following components to satisfy the marketing team's
requirements. Consider both static and repeated loadings.

\begin{enumerate}
\item spring

\item proper inner diameter for the handle

\item required bolt size
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Note}: feel free to reasonably assume the values of any other
parameters not given by the marketing team.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A bicycle has dimensions shown in
\end{enumerate}
[[\#fig: bike-example]\ref{fig: bike-example}]. Your task is modify it for
off-road riding by

\begin{enumerate}
\item adding spring suspension to the front (1 spring) fork and under the
seat (1 spring).

\item replacing the screws holding the wheels to the forks (front and
rear).

\item redoing the weld at the seat connection.
\end{enumerate}

Since this is going to become an off-road bike, assume that the maximum
loads on the front and rear wheels are going to be like when a 5000-N
person rides it. Assume that the bike itself is weightless, the front
and seat springs should contract by 2 cm and 2.5 cm, respectively at the
maximum loads.

The coefficient friction between the forks and wheel hub is 0.5. One
bolt is required for the front forks, and one for the rear forks.

The fillet weld at the seat, though circular, can be calculated much the
same way as a straight fillet weld. The diameter of the seat connection
with the frame tube is 3 cm, and the weld length is equal to the
circumference of the tube.

\emph{Note}: To simplify the calculation, you may assume that the seat
springs and front springs are vertical during the ride.

Analysis of a Simplified Fruit Juice Press

A fruit juice press, used to press juice out of fruits like apple,
orange, or lime, typically consists of a stand, a lever, and a press.
The simplified schematic drawing of the press is shown in
[[\#fig: fruit juicer]\ref{fig: fruit juicer}].


\url{pictures/Machine-interaction/fruit-juicer}

The user pushes or pulls down the end of the lever, the press will
squeeze the fruit, extracting its juice. The lever is made of AISI1020
steel, the stand is made of aluminum, and the press is made of
high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The material properties of each are as
follows.

The stand and press are both solid cylinders, while the lever has a
solid square cross section. Assume that all parts have constant
cross-sectional areas throughout their lengths, and that any fruit
requires 500 N from the press to squeeze. The bottom of the stand is
fixed to the desk, while its other end and the press are pinned to the
lever. Determine:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The free body diagram of the stand, lever, and press while the press
is squeezing down on a fruit, giving both direction and magnitude for
each force and moment.

\item The proper cross section for the stand, lever, and press when
considering only static loading. Use safety factor = 3.

\item The proper thickness of the lever when considering repeated loadings.
Use safety factor = 4.

Structure

On an outing camp to a remote village, you find that the villagers lack
aa clean water source and want to help them construct a water well.
After some initial planning, your team agree that the structure should
have two identical columns, a beam, and a pulley hoist as shown in the

\chapter{Introduction to Computer-aided Design}
\label{introduction-to-computer-aided-design}
Nowadays, computers facilitate various engineering tasks from simulation
to programming to design. Before computer-aided design software usage
become widespread, mechanical design processes of drawing, analysis,
testing, and prototyping of components can take a long period of time.
With the availability of these software packages, multiple design tasks
can be done in the virtual environment, speeding up the process while
saving the cost of actual experimental setups.

There are many software CAD packages available on the market covering a
wide range of engineering disciplines from a multidisciplinary
engineering software that integrates multiple physical regimes to more
specific solutionss that tackle fluid mechanics, heat transfer, or solid
mechanics. Many CAD software packages can also be process-specific,
specializing in designs for stamping, casting, or forging. Therefore, it
is important to know the scope and objective of your design to pick the
right tools for the job!

In this book, the main effort has been focused on designing and
optimizing load-bearing structures and joints. With that, the software
package that will be demonstrated here is SolidWorks (version 2016),
which specializes in 3-dimensional drawing, modeling, and analysis.

After taking the previous class of ME 200: Mechanical Drawing, students
should already be proficient with drawing 3-dimensional solids and
assembling parts using SolidWorks. This chapter will focus mainly on
finite element analysis of a given part using SolidWorks.

\section{Finite Element Analysis (FEA)}
\label{finite-element-analysis-fea}
Generally, structures are composed of multiple members. Machines and
their components also typically involved complicated geometries,
loadings, and material properties. Therefore, it becomes clear that the
classical methods and formulas can be impractical in analyzing
complicated parts. For complex structures, we sometimes have to resort
to more general approaches of analysis; one of the most widespread being
the finite element stiffness or \emph{displacement method}---referred to as
the \emph{finite element method} (FEM) from now on. Finite element analysis
(FEA) is a numerical approach well-suited to modern computers. This
method relies on the formulation of a simultaneous set of algebraic
equations that establish the relationship between forces and
displacements at discrete selected points on the structure. These
governing algebraic equations are expressed in matrix notation.

The basic concept of the finite element approach is that the real
structure can be divided by a finite number of elements, connected not
only at their nodes, but also along the element boundaries. Triangular,
rectangular, tetrahedral, quadrilateral, or hexagonal shapes of elements
are commonly used in the finite element method. The types of elements
that are commonly employed in structural idealization are the truss,
beam, two-dimensional elements, shell and plate bending, and
three-dimensional elements. Often large structural systems are analyzed
by dividing the structure into smaller units or substructures.

The network of elements and nodes that discretize the region is called a
mesh. The density of a mesh increases as more elements are placed within
a region. Mesh refinement is the modification of mesh in an analysis of
a model to give improved solutions. The size and number of elements are
determined by the complexity of the structure and the desired accuracy.
Results usually improve when the mesh density is increased in areas of
high stress concentrations and when geometric transition zones are
meshed smoothly. So more elements are required where the local stresses
are of interest. Generally, the FEA results converge toward the exact
solution as the mesh is continuously refined. However, more element also
require more computation time, so there is a price to pay for more
accuracy.

To cover the entire discussion on the subject of FEA would require a
much longer chapter that this. Regardless, this is a very important
topic, and any engineer concerned with the analysis should at least have
an understanding of FEA. The fundamentals presented here can hopefully
exhibit the potential of FEA as well as its complexities. For
simplicity, only two basic structural elements will be discussed here;
the one dimensional \emph{bar element} and the \emph{beam element}.

\section{Bar Elements}
\label{bar-elements}
A bar element, also known as a truss bar element or axial element, can
be considered the simplest form of structural finite element. An element
of this type with length \(L\), Young's modulus \(E\), and cross-sectional
area \(A\) has two nodes, one at each end. The nodes are numbered 1 and 2,
respectively. It is important to develop a set of two equations in
matrix form to relate the \emph{joint forces} to the \emph{joint displacements}.

\subsection{Direct Equilibrium Method}
\label{direct-equilibrium-method}
The derivation based on the direct equilibrium method, obviously, is
simple and clear. It is, however, only practically applicable to bar and
frame elements. The equilibrium of forces along the length of the
element requires that the forces must be equal and opposite. Because
\(AE / L\) is the spring constant of the element, we have

$$\begin{gathered}
    F_1 = \frac{AE}{L}(u_1 - u_2) \hfill \\
    F_1 = \frac{AE}{L}(u_2 - u_1) \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}$$

This can also be written in the following matrix form:

$$\left\{
    \begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
      F_1 \\ 
      F_2 
    \end{array} \right\} = \frac{AE}{L}\left[
    \begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
      1 & -1 \\ 
     -1 & 1 
   \end{array} \right]\left\{
    \begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
    u_1 \\ 
    u_2 
   \end{array} \right\}$$

or symbolically

$$\left\{ \mathbf{F} \right\} = \left[ \mathbf{k} \right]\left\{ \mathbf{u} \right\}$$

where \([\mathbf{k}]\) is called the \emph{stiffness matrix} of the element.
The matrix relates the joint displacement to the joint forces on the
element.

\subsection{Energy Method}
\label{energy-method}
The energy method, which has been mentioned and partially discussed in
\hyperref[subsub: energy method]{3.5.8.2}, is applicable to finite element
analysis as well. In fact, the method is easier, more powerful than the
direct equilibrium approach, especially for more sophisticated elements.
To use method, it is important to first define a displacement function
for the element.

$$u = a_1 + a_2x$$

in which \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are constants. This equation represents a
linear displacement variation along the length of the element \(x\). The
axial displacements at nodes 1 (\(x\) = 0) and 2 (\(x\) = L) are, therefore,

$$\begin{gathered}
  u_1 = a_1 \hfill \\
  u_2 = a_1 + a_2L \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}$$

Solving the preceding equation and obtaining \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we
substitute them into equation to get

$$u = \left( 1 - \frac{x}{L} \right)u_1 + \frac{x}{L}u_2$$

The strain is equal to

$$\varepsilon  = \frac{du}{dx} = \frac{-u_1 + u_2}{L}$$

The axial force acting on the element is

$$F = E\varepsilon A = \frac{{AE}}{L}( - {u_1} + {u_2})$$

The strain energy can be derived as

$$U = \int_0^L \frac{F^2dx}{2AE} = \frac{AE}{2L}\left( u_1^2 - 2u_1u_2 + u_2^2 \right)$$

Applying Castigliano's first theorem to derive forces as functions of
displacements, we have

\begin{gather}
\label{eqn: stiffness matrix energy}
  F_1 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial u_1} = \frac{AE}{L}\left( u_1 + u_2 \right) \hfill \\
  F_2 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial u_2} = \frac{AE}{L}\left( -u_1 + u_2 \right) \hfill \\ 
\end{gather}

The stiffness matrix derived from [[\#eqn: stiffness matrix energy]\ref{eqn: stiffness matrix energy}] is the same as those given in [[\#eqn: stiffness matrix equilibrium]\ref{eqn: stiffness matrix equilibrium}].

\section{Beam Elements}
\label{beam-elements}
Consider an initially straight beam element of uniform cross section.
The element, obviously, has a constant moment of inertia \(I\), Young's
modulus \(E\), and length \(L\). The element has a transverse deflection \(v\)
and a slope at each end. Also, at each end there is a transverse shear
force \(F_y\) and a bending moment \(M\).

The linearly elastic behavior of a beam element is governed by Equation
but that the loading term is zero because in the formulation of the
stiffness matrix, we assume no loading between nodes or ends. In other
words, the forces and bending moments are concentrated at the nodes.

We then proceed to assume a vertical displacement function along the
length of the beam element. In this example, it is assumed that the
function is cubic and takes the form.

$$ v = a_1 + a_2x + a_3x^2 + a_4x^3$$

With this equation, the number of terms is identical to that of the
number of nodal displacements of the element (\(v_1\), \(\theta_1\), \(v_2\),
\(\theta_2\)) and so the equation satisfies the basic beam equations, the
conditions of displacement, and the continuity of interelement nodes.
The coefficients \(a_1\), \(a_2\), \(a_3\), and \(a_4\) can be determined using
the conditions at both ends (\(x\) = 0 and \(x = L\)):

\begin{gather*}
  v_1 = a_1 \hfill \\
  \theta _1 = \frac{dv_1}{dx} = a_2 \hfill \\
  v_2 = a_1 + a_2L + a_3L^2 + a_4L^3 \hfill \\
  \theta_2 = \frac{dv_2}{dx} = a_2 + 2a_3L + 3a_4L^2 \hfill \\ 
\end{gather*}

Arranging the equations into matrix form, we have

$$\left\{ \begin{gathered}
  v_1 \hfill \\
  \theta _1 \hfill \\
  v_2 \hfill \\
  \theta _2 \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}  \right\} = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
  1&0&0&0 \\ 
  0&1&0&0 \\ 
  1&L&L^2&L^3 \\ 
  1&1&2L&3L^2 
\end{array}} \right]\left\{ \begin{gathered}
  a_1 \hfill \\
  a_2 \hfill \\
  a_3 \hfill \\
  a_4 \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}  \right\}$$

Deriving the inverse of the preceding matrix multiplication yields

\begin{gather*}
\label{eqn: inverse displacement matrix}
  \left\{
    \begin{gathered}
      a_1 \hfill \\
      a_2 \hfill \\
      a_3 \hfill \\
      a_4 \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}  \right\} = \frac{1}{L^3}\left[{
      \begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
        L^3&0&0&0 \\ 
        0&L^3&0&0 \\ 
        -3L&-2L^2&3L&-L^2 \\ 
        2&L&-2&L 
      \end{array}} \right]\left\{
    \begin{gathered}
      v_1 \hfill \\
      \theta_1 \hfill \\
      v_2 \hfill \\
      \theta_2 \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}  \right\}
\end{gather*}

Substitute
[[\#eqn: inverse displacement matrix]\ref{eqn: inverse displacement matrix}]
into
[[\#eqn: beam element displacement function]\ref{eqn: beam element displacement function}]
gives

$$v = v_1 + x\theta_1 - \frac{3x^2}{L}v_1 - \frac{2x^2}{L^2}\theta_1 + \frac{3x^2}{L^2}v_2 - \frac{x^2}{L}\theta_2 + \frac{2x^3}{L^3}v_1 + \frac{x^3}{L^2}\theta_1 - \frac{2x^3}{L^3}v_2 + \frac{x^3}{L^2}\theta_2$$

We also know that the bending moment \(M\) and shear force \(V\) in an
elastic beam with symmetrical cross section about the plane of loading
are related to the displacement function \(v\) by
[[\#eqn: shear force and load intensity]\ref{eqn: shear force and load intensity}]
as

$$\begin{gathered}
  F_{1y} = V_1 = EI\frac{d^3v}{dx^3} \hspace{0.5cm} \text{and} \hspace{0.5cm}
  M_1 =  -EI\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} \hspace{0.2cm} \text{ at }x = 0 \hfill \\
  F_{2y} =  -V_2 =  - EI\frac{d^3v}{dx^3} \hspace{0.5cm} \text{and}
  \hspace{0.5cm} M_2 = EI\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} \hspace{0.2cm} \text{ at }x = L \hfill \\ \end{gathered}$$

It can then be shown that the nodal force (moment) and deflection
(slope) relations in a beam element is

\begin{gather*}
  \left\{ \begin{gathered}
      F_{1y} \hfill \\
      M_1 \hfill \\
      F_{2y} \hfill \\
      M_2 \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}
  \right\} = \frac{EI}{L^3}
  \left[
    \begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
      12&6L&-12&6L \\ 
      6L&4L^2&-6L&2L^2 \\ 
      -12&-6L&12&-6L \\ 
      6L&2L^2&-6L&4L^2 
    \end{array}
  \right]
  \left\{
    \begin{gathered}
      v_1 \hfill \\
      \theta _1 \hfill \\
      v_2 \hfill \\
      \theta _2 \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}
  \right\}
\end{gather*}

More concisely,

$$\left\{ \mathbf{F} \right\} = \left[ \mathbf{k} \right]\left\{ \bm\delta \right\}$$

In fact, this last equation is the basis for most finite element
analysis software. By developing a stiffness matrix [*k*], the program
can determine nodal deformations for given nodal forces and moments.

\section{Finite Element Analysis using Solidworks}
\label{finite-element-analysis-using-solidworks}
As mentioned previously, students should already be previously familiar
with Solidworks from ME 200. The main application of Solidworks in that
class is to facilitate three-dimensional drawings and demonstrate
general usage of the software in dimensioning, giving tolerances,
drawing shapes, and simulating assemblies. In this chapter, we will
further explore the capabilities of Solidworks for use in stress,
strain, deformation/displacement, and safety factor analyses of simple
components. The module required to perform said analyses is called
Solidworks Simulation.

The module is capable of performing various types of simulations such as
static, thermal, frequency, drop test, buckling, fatigue, nonlinear,
etc. Based on relevancy, we will focus on static, buckling, and fatigue
analyses. However, before diving into individual analyses, we will first
explore some common features of these analyses.

\subsection{Solidworks Simulation Module Basics}
\label{solidworks-simulation-module-basics}
Once installed, the module can be accessed by clicking Solidworks add-in
tab and choose Solidworks Simulation, after which the type of simulation
can be selected.

To perform most of the analyses, the materials from which each component
is made must first be specified. This is to assign various material
properties of the component such as the Young's modulus, Poisson's
ratio, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, etc. which would then
be used in each analysis. Solidworks already includes a relatively large
material library with the default installation, although a user may want
to create a custom material if he so wishes.

It is also desirable in most analyses that the fixtures of the component
be specified. Note that Solidworks does not allow parts without at least
one fixtures to be analyzed, even if the parts are under equilibrium. In
this class, we would like to focus on the application of free-body
diagrams to determine the configuration of each component, converting
its connection with other adjacent components into fixtures and loads.

The fixture submenu provides multitude of default fixture configurations
such as fixed and hinges. The user may also wish to create a custom
fixture under advanced fixtures---called use reference geometry---based
on the geometry of the part to control the degrees of freedom of the
fixture.

Once fixtures have been specified, the user may assign loads onto the
components. Assigned loads can be a force, moment, torque, centrifugal
force, etc. Apply the loads obtained from free body diagram on
corresponding surfaces or positions.

One last step is to create mesh for the component. The user can allow
Solidworks to determine and automatically draw suitable meshes for the
component, or specify custom meshes themselves. Finer meshes allow for
greater accuracy and more detailed calculations at the cost of computing
power and time.

Now, let us delve further into the details of each type of analysis.

\subsection{Static Analysis}
\label{static-analysis}
Static analysis can be performed to determine the stresses, strains, and
safety factors in the component. In addition, a preliminary static
analysis must be performed before a fatigue analysis---based on the
loading configuration of the static analysis---can be performed.

To perform a static analysis, choose static submenu and assign
corresponding materials. Fixtures and loads can then be specified.
Finally, the user may choose to customize the meshes, or click perform
the analysis right away by choosing run. It is important to note that
Solidworks cannot analyze a component that does not have a fixture. For
example, if a bar is under equal tensile loads on both ends, it is under
static equilibrium. However, the bar is interpreted as free-floating by
Solidworks and the static analysis will fail. Only when one of the
tensile loads is converted into a fixture---in this case, a fixed
support---can the analysis be successfully completed.

Static analysis of a bicycle crank using Solidworks


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Intro-CAD/bike-crank-set.jpg}
\end{center}

Assume that a professional cyclist can apply a maximum downward load of
1500 N with his foot.

It is possible to model and analyze the entire bicycle crank assembly in
one go. However, in the scope of this chapter, it is beneficial to start
with a piece-by-piece analysis of the crank. In this case, students can
rely on free body diagrams to determine the on the crank.

Obviously, when the cyclist exerts the 1500-N load, it is not directly
onto the crank end itself, but rather on the pedal which is attached to
the end of the crank. If we assume that the pedal is 15 cm long and the
load is a concentrated load right at the middle of the pedal, then the
load creates both a 1500-N tensile force and 1500
\(\times (0.015)/2 = 11.25\) N-m moment at the end of the crank. On the
other end of the crank, we can simply fix the square bolt hole surfaces
as shown in the figure.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pictures/Intro-CAD/Crank-before-running.png}
\end{center}

Once we have applied the loads and fixture. We can proceed to run the
analysis. Note that for more complex analysis, we may wish to manually
draw meshes. In this simplified example, however, we are going to let
SolidWorks decide the proper mesh automatically.

After the simulation is completed, we obtain the following (default) Von
Mises stress plot.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Intro-CAD/Crank-result-front.png}
\end{center}

We should also check the back surface for any location with outstanding
stress.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Intro-CAD/Crank-result-back.png}
\end{center}

The critical point is at the rounded surface on the fixed end. The
maximum Von Mises (\(\sigma_e\)) is 83 MPa. The yield strength is written
on the bottom of the legend at 275 MPa. We can also convert the stress
plot to safety factor (or as SolidWorks call it 'factor of safety'). The
aluminum alloy used within this case is a ductile material, so we use
the MDET to determine safety factors.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Intro-CAD/Crank-safety-factor.png}
\end{center}

It is shown that the corresponding minimum safety factor is 3.3.

\subsection{Buckling Analysis}
\label{buckling-analysis}
Solidworks buckling analysis is used mainly to determine the critical
load and corresponding mode shape (see section 4.3) of the part. Its
required inputs are identical to those of static analysis: materials,
loads, and fixtures. After the simulation is finished, Solidworks will
report mode shape by showing the model's deflection. On the same screen,
Solidworks will also report a load factor, which is the multiple of the
input load required to cause buckling. In other words, if the input
compressive load is 100 N, and Solidworks report a load factor of 4, the
critical load is 4 \(\times\) 100 = 400 N.

Buckling analysis of a crank using Solidworks

Using the same crank as in the previous example, we understand that
buckling can only happen under compressively, which is when the pedal
end of the crank comes all the way up to the top of the rotation. We
will assume that the same 1500-N and 11.25 N-m load still apply. It is
important to note, however, that the 1500 N is now compressive and the
bending moment is in the opposite direction compared to the previous
example.

Applying the condition under 'buckling' analysis in SolidWorks, we
obtain the following figure.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{pictures/Intro-CAD/Crank-buckling.png}
\end{center}

From the figure, the load factor of 95.8 indicated the buckling safety
factor.

\subsection{Fatigue Analysis}
\label{fatigue-analysis}
A fatigue analysis required that a static analysis with identical
fixture and loading conditions have already been run, since fatigue
analysis will only allow that the user modify the material and the loads
using loading factors (\(LF\)) and loading ratios (\(LR\)). The loading
factor is simply the multiple of the applied static load referred to in
the static analsis. In other words,

$$LF = \frac{F_{fatigue}}{F_{static}}$$

The loading ratio is defined as the ratio between the minimum and
maximum load, which can be expressed mathematically as

$$LR = \frac{F_{\min}}{F_{\max }}$$

i.e. when LR = -1, the repeated loading is said to be \emph{fully reversed}.

Consider this example: to simulate a thin bar under fatigue loading in
which the range of applied axial load is between -300 N (compressive)
and 300 N, you must first have at least perform a static analysis of
that same component under axial load. Let us assume that the axial load
used in the static analysis is 200 N. The loading factor used in this
case should be 300/200 = 1.5, and the proper loading ratio should be -1
(since -300/300 = -1).

Fatigue analysis of a crank using Solidworks

Using the same bicycle crank, we will determine its fatigue life.

Selecting fatigue study and use our static axial and torque loads as our
baseline case. Under normal operation, a bicycle crank continuously
rotate while we can assume that the force and torque remain constant. As
such, the resultant stress from the combined loading must be fully
reversed due to the continuous change in orientation of the crank.
Setting loading ratio = 1, we obtain the following fatigue life figure.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pictures/Intro-CAD/Crank-fatigue-front.jpg}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pictures/Intro-CAD/Crank-fatigue-back.jpg}
\end{center}

As expected, critical points (the corner of square bolt hole and the
rounded surface back surface ) on the crank have the lowest fatigue life
at approximately 90,000 cycles. It is important to note that this number
is based on average values of material properties and should not be
taken as an exact useful life.

\section{Summary}
\label{summary-9}
As personal computers become increasingly powerful, so does finite
element analysis programs. While understanding the basics of load and
stress analyses remain crucial, it is important as well for students to
take advantage of the growing popularity and availability of finite
element analysis software solutions and get familiarized with their
basics. Solidworks is as good a starting place as any other software to
learn about the fundamentals of FEA.

However, powerful though an FEA program may be, it is still far from
all-knowing: the program cannot possibly give correct answers with
incorrect inputs. Hence, students must understand how to model loads,
fixtures, and other conditions accurately to utilize the full potential
of the software.
